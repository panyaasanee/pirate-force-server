"""Turns one authorized GM chat line into an outbound wire ACTION, or None.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (the measured gap it closes)
---------------------------------------------------
`lane_hooks/lane_gm_chat_command.py` already routes an inbound 0xAC52 chat
line to `gm/chat_command.handle_local_talk_chat`, and `CORE-REQUEST-GM-028`
asks chief for a `lane_hooks.fire()` point at the 0xAC52 branch to drive it.
That request, as written, CANNOT ever move a character on screen, and this
module exists because that was worth stating plainly instead of discovering
it after an attended boot:

`lane_hooks.fire()` is fire-and-forget by explicit contract -- its own
docstring says "Never returns a value; hooks that need to hand something
back to runtime.py are not what this point shape is for".  And a LANE can put
bytes on the wire by exactly one route: the `(label, pc, frame, delay)`
action list `runtime.py`'s `dispatch()` RETURNS, which the legacy serve loop
drains at `current/pf_login_game_server_v141.py:7755`.  (Precision, after
pf-adversary's defect 11: that is not the only `sendall` in the process --
the legacy file has four, including a heartbeat worker thread at 7428 and the
login/select sites at 7994/8002.  None of them is reachable from a lane; the
claim is about what a lane can queue, not about how many sockets writes exist.)
Nothing on a session object can queue a frame either -- `src/.../connection.py`
is accept/bind/close plumbing with no action queue, and `gm/dispatch.py`'s own
docstring already said it out loud: "this lane has no send path outside a
CORE-REQUEST wiring point".

So GT-127 under GM-028's shape decides "did the server READ the line",
judged on the ndjson audit log -- which is what that entry honestly says it
decides.  It does not and cannot decide "did the character move".  This
module is the missing half: a single function chief can call from the same
0xAC52 branch that RETURNS an action, in exactly the shape
`runtime.py:5122`'s `gm_state_action` (CORE-REQUEST-006) already uses and
`runtime.py:5331` already appends.  `CORE-REQUEST-GM-029` asks for that one
call site and SUPERSEDES GM-028's fire-only shape.

🔴 WIRE EXACTLY ONE OF THE TWO.  If both the `fire()` point and this
function are wired at the 0xAC52 branch, every GM chat line is authorized
twice, audited twice (two ndjson rows for one typed line) and charged twice
against `chat_command`'s own rate limit -- the second charge being the one
that silently starts refusing real commands.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
* It does not decide GM status.  `handle_local_talk_chat` does, on the
  authenticated `session.token`, before it decodes a byte -- one
  authorization point for this lane, not two (the mistake this module would
  make by re-checking the allowlist "to be safe").
* It does not cross scenes.  `ForcePos` carries no scene id at all (RE-090);
  `gm/warp_executor.py` refuses a cross-scene `warp` rather than send an
  in-scene hop that misrepresents what happened.  Cross-scene warp needs
  `TeleportVital`, whose target/aux fields RE-090 leaves unproven.
* It does not send anything for `npc`/`item`/`lv`/`spawn`/`say`.  Those
  parse and audit exactly as before and return no action -- naming them here
  as "not wired yet" by event is the difference between a lane that is
  honest about its coverage and one that looks broken.
* 🔴 It does not put a single ForcePos byte on the wire today, because
  `teleport_wire.FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` is None (RE-129 open).
  See that constant's own comment: the vital version byte is per-vital
  (0x5A19 -> 0, SelectActor -> 10) and GT-101 measured what an unproven
  version does to a real client -- modal error, connection halted, socket
  closed.  This module gates on the constant being not-None for the same
  reason `runtime.py:5107` gates the login GM-state frame on
  `state_wire.GM_UPDATE_STATE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED`, and refuses by name
  instead.  When RE-129 answers, that one constant is the whole change.

🔴 OPEN, AND IT MUST BE ANSWERED BEFORE RE-129 CHANGES THE CONSTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------
pf-adversary (this round) asked the question this design does not answer:
after a ForcePos leaves, WHO OWNS THE CHARACTER'S POSITION?  This module
composes a frame and stops.  It does not call `foundation.checkpoint`, so the
durable row and `selected.position` still hold the pre-warp point, and the
only thing that reconciles them is the client's next `TargetPos` -- which
requires the GM to move, and which `runtime.py:5595` does not even checkpoint
while a `scene_load_scenario` is loaded.  Meanwhile the ndjson audit row says
`executed: false` and is written identically whether the frame went out or
was withheld at the version gate, so the log cannot answer it either.

That is a deliberate limit of GM-003 v1 (parse/audit only), not an oversight
found late -- but it stops being harmless the moment bytes actually go out,
because "the client is at (3000,3000), the database says (0,0)" then has no
defined answer.  Written into `GT-128`'s preconditions as a third blocker so
nobody boots the visible warp before the question is settled, and raised to
COO in `notes_to_chief/20260828_18xx_LANE-GM-ASK-COO-*`.

ALSO OPEN, same reason (recorded, not fixed here):
* No coordinate range check.  `warp_executor` rejects NaN/Inf but accepts
  anything up to +/-3.4e38, so a decimal slip (`/warp 2 100000 200`) composes
  a real frame for a point this project elsewhere calls off the map --
  `world_scene_entry.py` refuses exactly that with `RELOCATED_OUTSIDE_GROUND`
  against a scene's `ground_extent`.  The fix is to reuse lane A's check by
  import (never to copy its logic here); it is not done this round, and the
  version gate means nothing can reach a client before it is.
* `accounts.is_gm_account` re-reads and re-parses the allowlist JSON on every
  call, and this module is what first makes that read reachable on every chat
  line of every player.  Identity-first ordering means a non-GM still causes
  no write, no decode and no rate-limit charge (measured) -- but it is one
  uncached `stat` + `open` + `json.load` per frame on the shared listener
  thread.  Caching it changes what "editing the config takes effect when"
  means, which deserves its own decision rather than a silent change here.
* `ForcePosBody`'s field names.  `PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv` proves three f32
  at struct +0/+4/+8 and carries NO axis names; `x, y, z` is a name this lane
  assigned, and this module is what makes it load-bearing by pairing the
  command's two arguments with `Position.z`.  `Position`'s own ordering is
  proven by `make_login_teleport`, but that is a different message, and two
  layers agreeing is consistency, not proof.  RE-129 carries this as its
  second question.  [สมมติของสาย GM - รอ RE]

FAIL-CLOSED
-----------
The call site is inside chief's dispatch, on the game-listener thread, for
every chat line every player sends.  An exception escaping here would take
that thread down for everyone -- so nothing escapes: every failure is caught,
named on `session.events`, and reported as "no action".  Not sending is
always safe; this module can never do worse than the server did before it.
Event names carry refusal reasons and exception TYPE names only, never the
sentence a human typed and never an exception's message text (which can
embed client bytes): a console full of these leaks nothing about what
players said, and stays cp874-safe on the bridge console.
