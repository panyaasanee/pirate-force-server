# GM Lane -- GM / developer tools for faster attended testing

Owner order: PANYA-ORDER 2026-08-26 16:1x (+07:00), pf_bridge
`notes_to_chief/20260826_1630_PANYA-ORDER-open-Lane-GM-plus-attended-recon-GM-packets-already-in-client-registry.md`.

## What this lane is, in one sentence

GM tools exist to shorten the time a human tester spends reaching a
test-ready state -- not to prove any gameplay system works. Every test entry
that uses a GM shortcut must carry an explicit **nonclaim** line naming which
step it skipped (see "Nonclaim rule" below). "Warped to an island and saw
the island" is not a pass for that island's own scene-load feature.

## Write zone

- `src/pirateforce_foundation/gm/` -- all new modules for this lane
- `scenarios/gm_*.json`
- `tests/test_gm_*.py`
- `docs/GM_LANE.md` (this file)

`runtime.py`, `app.py`, and `current/pf_login_game_server_v141.py` belong to
chief. Any wiring into those files goes through a `CORE-REQUEST-GM-<nnn>`
letter in `pf_bridge/notes_to_chief/`, one letter per wiring point, naming
the module, the function to call, and the exact spot in runtime (login /
vital dispatch).

## Security invariant (does not change with any future decision)

- GM status is granted only to accounts listed in the server-side
  `gm_accounts` allowlist (`gm/accounts.py`). Default is the empty list --
  nobody is GM until an operator lists an account.
- The client has no message that requests GM status for itself. The static
  survey in the 1630 letter found no `/xxx` command strings and no
  client->server "become GM" vital anywhere in the client image. This lane's
  code never adds one.
- This holds even with `production_allowed=true`, because none of it is
  behind a flag: an unlisted account gets nothing different, ever.

## Wire facts used (pinned)

All three come from `pf_bridge/VITAL_REGISTRY_FROM_CLIENT_BINARY_20260817.tsv`
and `pf_bridge/external/PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv` (span_sha256 pinned in the
docstring of each module that depends on it -- re-derive and compare before
trusting a claim here that a mismatch would invalidate):

| vital id | name | direction | layout status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x5A19 | `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` | server->client | **proven**: u8tag(0x0B) + u8tag(0x0B) + u32tag(0x14), span_sha256 `03b18673...033c661` |
| 0x51E9 | `GM_RunGMCommandVital` | client->server | **RE-088 PASS/DONE -- STRUCTURAL-LAYOUT-PINNED** (outer `0x00729E10` span_sha256 `541d82f5...c8554`, nested `0x00726C20` span_sha256 `aa3c7c8d...93559d`): one presence flag `u8tag(0x0B)`; when nonzero, exactly one nested body `u32tag(0x14) + u32tag(0x14) + u8tag(0x0B) + UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE + UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE`. RE-088 closes the earlier "two runtime-selected sub-paths" question this doc used to carry: the presence flag gates one nested serializer call, not a sub-opcode choosing between two shapes, and RE-088 found no field it could prove is a separate sub-opcode. **Field meaning is still NOT proven** -- the two wide strings are not confirmed to be a command name and its argument text, and the live chat-input trigger condition is RE-091 (open). Decoder: `gm/command_wire.py`. |
| 0x8C77 | `GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` | server->client | **proven**: single u8tag(0x0B) @+0x14, span_sha256 `ad65d125...633e9`. Meaning of the byte not proven (RE-088 explicitly declines to call it success/error). Decoder: `gm/command_wire.py`. |
| 0x162E | `CheatVital` | both | proven: single UNTAGGED_STRING8_LEN32LE @+0x14 (reference only, not reused as GM wire) |
| 0x9F2C | `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital` | server->client | registered in RUNTIME_CLASSMAP; field layout not yet pinned by this lane |

### Correction (filed after `pf-adversary` review, same round)

The first draft of this file and of `gm/command_capture.py`/`gm/commands.py`
copied notes_to_chief `20260826_1630`'s claim that `GM_RunGMCommandVital` /
`GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` had no rows in `PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv`. That
letter was written 2026-08-26 16:30 +07:00; the rows were actually added
earlier the same day by `pf_bridge` commit `5ab34dc` (2026-08-26 02:50 UTC =
09:50 +07:00). This round re-derived the table at HEAD instead of trusting
the citation, found the rows, and corrected every place that repeated the
stale claim -- this is exactly the "re-derive again before citing a current
number" rule `AGENTS.md` states and this round initially failed to apply.

## Modules delivered (round one)

- `gm/accounts.py` (GM-001) -- `is_gm_account` / `load_gm_accounts`, JSON
  config, default empty.
- `gm/state_wire.py` (GM-001) -- `make_gm_update_state_payload` /
  `make_gm_update_state_frame` for 0x5A19. The three field values are plain
  integer parameters, not named booleans: their meaning is unresolved,
  labelled `[สมมติของสาย GM - รอ RE]` in the module docstring, and wiring is
  requested via `CORE-REQUEST-006` (proposed; the shared cross-lane counter,
  not a lane-local number -- see `notes_to_chief` letter) to pin them
  against client handler `0x00729F00`.
- `gm/command_capture.py` (GM-002) -- `capture_raw_gm_command`, a raw
  hex-dump sink for 0x51E9. Does not parse or interpret even though a
  structural candidate layout is now known (see the wire-facts table above)
  -- the point is to have real bytes on disk, unique per capture (a
  same-second collision from the same account gets a numeric suffix, never
  a silent overwrite), so a later structural/semantic decoder has something
  real to check itself against.
- `gm/scene_catalog.py` (GM-004) -- scene id -> GM scene name, loaded from
  `gm/data/gm_scene_name_tip.tsv` (byte-identical copy of
  `pf_bridge/gamedata/tables/TEXTDATA_TH__SCENE_NAME_TIP.tsv`, sha256 pinned
  and checked at import time). 330 rows. Confirms Port Royal=1, Prison Exile
  Island=2, Spice Paradise Island=3 from the order letter. Available for
  lane A to reuse for its own travel/scene work -- notified via
  `notes_to_chief`.
- `gm/commands.py` (GM-003 v1) -- `parse_gm_command` / `log_gm_command` for
  the six command grammars (`warp` `npc` `item` `lv` `spawn` `say`).
  **Parses and logs only; executes nothing.** Executing `warp`/`spawn` needs
  proven `TeleportVital`/`ForcePos`/mob-spawn wiring that does not exist yet;
  executing `npc`/`item`/`lv` needs write access to player/world state
  outside this lane's write zone. Each becomes real once its dependency
  lands, via its own `CORE-REQUEST-<nnn>` letter (shared cross-lane
  counter; see `pf_bridge/CHIEF_CONTINUATION.md`).

## Modules delivered (RE-088 follow-up round)

RE-088 (`notes_to_chief/20260826_1811_RE-088-RESULT-GM-COMMAND-WIRE-PINNED.md`)
raised `GM_RunGMCommandVital`/`GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` from a structural
candidate to PASS/DONE and, in the same result, closed the "two
runtime-selected sub-paths" open question this doc used to carry: there is
one nested body, gated by a presence flag, not a sub-opcode choice. Its own
`BUILD_IMPACT` line says this makes GM-002's raw capture eligible to become
a schema-aware decode and gives GM-003 a codec -- but repeats, in the same
breath, that execution and command naming both stay forbidden until
semantics (RE-091) or a real capture close that gap.

- `gm/command_wire.py` (new) -- `decode_gm_run_command_vital` /
  `decode_gm_run_command_result_vital`, a pure decoder for the RE-088 pinned
  byte shape. Field names stay positional (`field_0x10`, `field_0x14`,
  `field_0x18`, `string_0x1c`, `string_0x38`) per RE-088's own nonclaims --
  nothing here is renamed to "command", "argument", or "result_code".
  Decodes only; does not execute, dispatch, or read off a live socket.
  Raises `GmCommandWireError` (never a bare crash) on anything that does not
  match the pin, including trailing bytes after an otherwise-clean decode.
- `gm/command_capture.py` (updated) -- `capture_raw_gm_command` now also
  attempts a decode via `command_wire.py` and writes the result into the
  capture file's header (`presence=0`, the decoded fields, or a `FAILED`
  line naming what did not match), **in addition to** the untouched raw hex
  dump, which never goes away. A decode failure is caught inside the sink,
  not propagated -- a capture must never be lost because a client sent
  something outside the pinned shape; that is exactly the fact GM-002 exists
  to record. The two decoded strings are client-controlled bytes and go
  through the same `unicode_escape` header-injection guard already used for
  `account_name`.

## What is intentionally NOT built yet, and why

- No wiring of `state_wire` into the actual login path -- that edit belongs
  to `runtime.py`/`app.py` (chief's territory). `CORE-REQUEST-006` asks for
  it explicitly: call `make_gm_update_state_frame` after a successful login
  for any account where `is_gm_account()` is true, and send the resulting
  frame to that connection.
- No command *execution* path (see `gm/commands.py` scope note above).
- No general lane-A scene registry or lane-B mob roster reuse in
  `gm/commands.py`. Both lanes' current modules
  (`world_scene_travel.py`, `field_mob_tables.py`) are single-destination /
  single-scene, not general id->data lookups; importing them for a generic
  multi-scene `warp`/`spawn` command would misrepresent what they actually
  cover. `gm/scene_catalog.py` (this lane's own, from committed gamedata) is
  used only as a non-blocking name hint for `warp`, never as proof a warp
  target is reachable.

## Nonclaim rule

Every PR and every attended test entry that uses a GM shortcut states, in
one line, which step the shortcut skipped, e.g.:

> nonclaim: reached the target scene via GM warp; this does not exercise or
> claim the player-driven travel/scene-load path.

## RE requests open (owned by static RE lane, filed via chief)

1. `GM_RunGMCommandVital` (`0x00729E10`/`0x00726C20`): **CLOSED structurally
   by RE-088** (one presence flag, one nested body, no proven sub-opcode --
   see wire-facts table). Still open: what the u32/u32/u8/wstring/wstring
   fields mean (are the two strings a command name and its argument text, or
   something else) -- folded into the live-trigger question below since
   `RE-091` is the request that will actually observe a real client sending
   this. `GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` (`0x00729790`): the single u8 result
   field at `+0x14` is proven positionally (RE-088); its meaning
   (success/error code?) is open.
2. `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` handler `0x00729F00`: which byte is which flag,
   what the u32 field means, what visibly changes on the client
   (`bm_gm.tga`, `GMModule_Client`).
3. `TeleportVital` / `ForcePos` / `CWarpResult` field layout.
4. Chat input -> 0x51E9 trigger condition (prefix? GM-state gate?), xref
   global id `0x01088F8C`.
