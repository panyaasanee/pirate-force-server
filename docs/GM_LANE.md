# GM Lane -- GM / developer tools for faster attended testing

Owner order: PANYA-ORDER 2026-08-26 16:1x (+07:00), pf_bridge
`notes_to_chief/20260826_1630_PANYA-ORDER-open-Lane-GM-plus-attended-recon-GM-packets-already-in-client-registry.md`.

## What this lane is, in one sentence

GM tools exist to shorten the time a human tester spends reaching a
test-ready state -- not to prove any gameplay system works. Every test entry
that uses a GM shortcut must carry an explicit **nonclaim** line naming which
step it skipped (see "Nonclaim rule" below). "Warped to an island and saw
the island" is not a pass for that island's own scene-load feature.

## Write zone

- `src/pirateforce_foundation/gm/` -- all new modules for this lane
- `scenarios/gm_*.json`
- `tests/test_gm_*.py`
- `docs/GM_LANE.md` (this file)

`runtime.py`, `app.py`, and `current/pf_login_game_server_v141.py` belong to
chief. Any wiring into those files goes through a `CORE-REQUEST-GM-<nnn>`
letter in `pf_bridge/notes_to_chief/`, one letter per wiring point, naming
the module, the function to call, and the exact spot in runtime (login /
vital dispatch).

## Security invariant (does not change with any future decision)

- GM status is granted only to accounts listed in the server-side
  `gm_accounts` allowlist (`gm/accounts.py`). Default is the empty list --
  nobody is GM until an operator lists an account.
- The client has no message that requests GM status for itself. The static
  survey in the 1630 letter found no `/xxx` command strings and no
  client->server "become GM" vital anywhere in the client image. This lane's
  code never adds one.
- This holds even with `production_allowed=true`, because none of it is
  behind a flag: an unlisted account gets nothing different, ever.

## Wire facts used (pinned)

All three come from `pf_bridge/VITAL_REGISTRY_FROM_CLIENT_BINARY_20260817.tsv`
and `pf_bridge/external/PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv` (span_sha256 pinned in the
docstring of each module that depends on it -- re-derive and compare before
trusting a claim here that a mismatch would invalidate):

| vital id | name | direction | layout status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x5A19 | `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` | server->client | **proven**: u8tag(0x0B) + u8tag(0x0B) + u32tag(0x14), span_sha256 `03b18673...033c661` |
| 0x51E9 | `GM_RunGMCommandVital` | client->server | **RE-088 PASS/DONE -- STRUCTURAL-LAYOUT-PINNED** (outer `0x00729E10` span_sha256 `541d82f5...c8554`, nested `0x00726C20` span_sha256 `aa3c7c8d...93559d`): one presence flag `u8tag(0x0B)`; when nonzero, exactly one nested body `u32tag(0x14) + u32tag(0x14) + u8tag(0x0B) + UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE + UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE`. RE-088 closes the earlier "two runtime-selected sub-paths" question this doc used to carry: the presence flag gates one nested serializer call, not a sub-opcode choosing between two shapes, and RE-088 found no field it could prove is a separate sub-opcode. **Field meaning is still NOT proven** -- the two wide strings are not confirmed to be a command name and its argument text, and the live chat-input trigger condition is RE-091 (open). Decoder: `gm/command_wire.py`. |
| 0x8C77 | `GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` | server->client | **proven**: single u8tag(0x0B) @+0x14, span_sha256 `ad65d125...633e9`. Meaning of the byte not proven (RE-088 explicitly declines to call it success/error). Decoder: `gm/command_wire.py`. |
| 0x162E | `CheatVital` | both | proven: single UNTAGGED_STRING8_LEN32LE @+0x14 (reference only, not reused as GM wire) |
| 0x9F2C | `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital` | server->client (Global-scope `Channel_*` family) | **already proven elsewhere in this repo -- do not re-derive or re-codec in this lane's zone.** `reports/PF_CHAT_CHANNEL001_CHANNEL_FAMILY_AND_ROUTING_STATIC_20260818.md` (byte-exact static, 69 static guards + `tests/test_chat_channel_family_static.py`, 15 passed) proves `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital` shares serializer `0x65AD40` with four other channels (LocalTalk/Party/Guild/ActorBoardcast) byte-for-byte identically: `tag 0x48 + u32 byte-length + UTF-16LE` wstring codec, field order `speaker@+0x34` then `body@+0x18`. This is a **different, more specific wire shape** than `pf_bridge/external/PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv`'s coarser `UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE` label for the same offsets implies (no leading tag byte) -- the report's claim is corroborated against real captured GT-006 frames (three independent byte-for-byte hash cross-checks against pins produced by an unrelated code path), which the TSV row alone is not. `src/pirateforce_foundation/channel_message_hypothesis.py` already implements a tested encoder/decoder for all five shared-serializer channels including this one (`CHANNEL_MESSAGE_FIELD_ORDER`, `SHARED_SERIALIZER_CHANNEL_IDS["Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital"] = 0x9F2C`). **This lane tried to build its own codec for this message in a since-retracted round (see "Attempted and retracted" below) before finding this.** `gm/say_wire.py` (say-wire round, below) now bridges a parsed `say` `GmCommand` to that existing encoder by import -- no second codec. |
| 0x0E80 | `ForcePos` | direction NOT_OBSERVED (0 captured frames either way, `PF_FIELD_VALIDATION.tsv`) | **RE-090 PASS/DONE**: vec3 only, three `f32tag(0x2A)` (X/Y/Z), span_sha256 `7c6f6cb7...860e0d`. Vital id is not a table row in `VITAL_REGISTRY_FROM_CLIENT_BINARY_20260817.tsv` (the client computes it at runtime from the name, it is not a stored constant); reproduced here from that file's own documented formula -- see "Vital id formula" below. Codec: `gm/teleport_wire.py`. |
| 0x1BA4 | `CWarpResult` | direction NOT_OBSERVED (0 captured frames either way) | **RE-090 PASS/DONE**: flat `qwordtag(0x32)` + vec3 (`f32tag(0x2A)` x3) + `u16tag(0x12)`, span_sha256 `5e3acf83...986c6db6a9`. The name `Result` is not evidence of direction. Codec: `gm/teleport_wire.py`. |
| 0x25A2 | `TeleportVital` | direction not confirmed, but NOT the same evidentiary state as the two rows above: 132 candidate frames per direction exist at status `A2_STATIC_OPEN` (candidate-matched, not parse-confirmed), unlike `ForcePos`/`CWarpResult`'s genuine zero | **RE-090 PASS/DONE**: `u8tag(0x0B)` field_0x18 -> presence-gated target object (stream order per RE-090's listing: `scene_id` u16tag(0x12), `scene_seq` qwordtag(0x32), then `field_0x10`/`field_0x11` u8 -- **not** ascending object-offset order, same pattern as the aux reorder below; `scene_id`/`scene_seq` are the same RE-077 crosswalk `player_wire.py`/`npc_wire.py` already use -- then vec3 f32tag(0x2A) x3) -> presence-gated auxiliary object (untagged wstring, then four more scalars, **wire order `+0x40` before `+0x38`** even though the object offset is lower -- RE-090 confirms this is real, not a transcription slip) -> `field_0x20` u8 -> `field_0x22` u16tag(0x0F). span_sha256 `fbe813db...df990487` (top), `ec9a5421...9a724df0b5ef` (target), `105bad91...6ccc049c93` (aux). Codec: `gm/teleport_wire.py`. The target field order is this lane's own reading of RE-090's prose listing, not independently re-verified against a real frame -- a follow-up round should run it against the 132 `A2_STATIC_OPEN` candidate frames before this is used against a real client (see the `TeleportTarget` docstring). |

### Vital id formula (ForcePos / CWarpResult)

`VITAL_REGISTRY_FROM_CLIENT_BINARY_20260817.tsv`'s own header states how the
client computes a message's wire id from its name at runtime:
`sum((i+1)*ord(c) for i,c in enumerate(name)) & 0xFFFF`. That formula
reproduces the file's own `TeleportVital=0x25A2` and
`TeleportCheckVital=0x4477` rows exactly, so it is trusted (not treated as a
new guess) to compute `ForcePos=0x0E80` and `CWarpResult=0x1BA4`, which are
registered in `external/PF_PROTOCOL_REGISTRY.tsv` by name but are not rows
in that particular table. `[สมมติของสาย GM - รอ RE]`: this is this lane's own
inference from a documented formula, not a disassembled call site proving
the client computes these two exact values -- one step less certain than
the PROVEN byte layouts in this table.

### Correction (filed after `pf-adversary` review, same round)

The first draft of this file and of `gm/command_capture.py`/`gm/commands.py`
copied notes_to_chief `20260826_1630`'s claim that `GM_RunGMCommandVital` /
`GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` had no rows in `PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv`. That
letter was written 2026-08-26 16:30 +07:00; the rows were actually added
earlier the same day by `pf_bridge` commit `5ab34dc` (2026-08-26 02:50 UTC =
09:50 +07:00). This round re-derived the table at HEAD instead of trusting
the citation, found the rows, and corrected every place that repeated the
stale claim -- this is exactly the "re-derive again before citing a current
number" rule `AGENTS.md` states and this round initially failed to apply.

## Modules delivered (round one)

- `gm/accounts.py` (GM-001) -- `is_gm_account` / `load_gm_accounts`, JSON
  config, default empty.
- `gm/state_wire.py` (GM-001) -- `make_gm_update_state_payload` /
  `make_gm_update_state_frame` for 0x5A19. The three field values are plain
  integer parameters, not named booleans: their meaning is unresolved,
  labelled `[สมมติของสาย GM - รอ RE]` in the module docstring, and wiring is
  requested via `CORE-REQUEST-006` (proposed; the shared cross-lane counter,
  not a lane-local number -- see `notes_to_chief` letter) to pin them
  against client handler `0x00729F00`.
- `gm/command_capture.py` (GM-002) -- `capture_raw_gm_command`, a raw
  hex-dump sink for 0x51E9. Does not parse or interpret even though a
  structural candidate layout is now known (see the wire-facts table above)
  -- the point is to have real bytes on disk, unique per capture (a
  same-second collision from the same account gets a numeric suffix, never
  a silent overwrite), so a later structural/semantic decoder has something
  real to check itself against.
- `gm/scene_catalog.py` (GM-004) -- scene id -> GM scene name, loaded from
  `gm/data/gm_scene_name_tip.tsv` (byte-identical copy of
  `pf_bridge/gamedata/tables/TEXTDATA_TH__SCENE_NAME_TIP.tsv`, sha256 pinned
  and checked at import time). 330 rows. Confirms Port Royal=1, Prison Exile
  Island=2, Spice Paradise Island=3 from the order letter. Available for
  lane A to reuse for its own travel/scene work -- notified via
  `notes_to_chief`.
- `gm/commands.py` (GM-003 v1) -- `parse_gm_command` / `log_gm_command` for
  the six command grammars (`warp` `npc` `item` `lv` `spawn` `say`).
  **Parses and logs only; executes nothing.** Executing `warp`/`spawn` needs
  proven `TeleportVital`/`ForcePos`/mob-spawn wiring that does not exist yet;
  executing `npc`/`item`/`lv` needs write access to player/world state
  outside this lane's write zone. Each becomes real once its dependency
  lands, via its own `CORE-REQUEST-<nnn>` letter (shared cross-lane
  counter; see `pf_bridge/CHIEF_CONTINUATION.md`).

## Modules delivered (RE-088 follow-up round)

RE-088 (`notes_to_chief/20260826_1811_RE-088-RESULT-GM-COMMAND-WIRE-PINNED.md`)
raised `GM_RunGMCommandVital`/`GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` from a structural
candidate to PASS/DONE and, in the same result, closed the "two
runtime-selected sub-paths" open question this doc used to carry: there is
one nested body, gated by a presence flag, not a sub-opcode choice. Its own
`BUILD_IMPACT` line says this makes GM-002's raw capture eligible to become
a schema-aware decode and gives GM-003 a codec -- but repeats, in the same
breath, that execution and command naming both stay forbidden until
semantics (RE-091) or a real capture close that gap.

- `gm/command_wire.py` (new) -- `decode_gm_run_command_vital` /
  `decode_gm_run_command_result_vital`, a pure decoder for the RE-088 pinned
  byte shape. Field names stay positional (`field_0x10`, `field_0x14`,
  `field_0x18`, `string_0x1c`, `string_0x38`) per RE-088's own nonclaims --
  nothing here is renamed to "command", "argument", or "result_code".
  Decodes only; does not execute, dispatch, or read off a live socket.
  Raises `GmCommandWireError` (never a bare crash) on anything that does not
  match the pin, including trailing bytes after an otherwise-clean decode.
- `gm/command_capture.py` (updated) -- `capture_raw_gm_command` now also
  attempts a decode via `command_wire.py` and writes the result into the
  capture file's header (`presence=0`, the decoded fields, or a `FAILED`
  line naming what did not match), **in addition to** the untouched raw hex
  dump, which never goes away. A decode failure is caught inside the sink,
  not propagated -- a capture must never be lost because a client sent
  something outside the pinned shape; that is exactly the fact GM-002 exists
  to record. The two decoded strings are client-controlled bytes and go
  through the same `unicode_escape` header-injection guard already used for
  `account_name`.

## Modules delivered (npc-switch-catalog round)

- `gm/npc_switch_catalog.py` (GM-003 support) -- mob_id -> the client's own
  name string, for the 7 rows in `pf_bridge/gamedata/tables/CONSTDATA_TH__MOBS.tsv`
  that carry `n_GM_SWITCH=1` (the "NPC กิจกรรม 7 ตัว" the owner's 1630 order
  letter already found: 855, 871, 882, 897, 902, 8180, 8181). Loaded from
  `gm/data/gm_npc_switch.tsv`, an extracted 2-column copy (sha256 pinned and
  checked at import time, same pattern as `scene_catalog.py`). This is this
  lane's own committed-gamedata derivation, not a reuse of any lane-B module
  (none exists yet that exposes a general mob_id -> name lookup -- see the
  note below, still true).
- `gm/commands.py` -- new `describe_npc_target(command)`, the same
  non-blocking hint pattern as `describe_warp_target`: for a parsed `npc`
  command, returns the client's name if `mob_id` is one of the 7
  GM-switchable NPCs, else `None`. A `None` result is not a validity gate --
  `npc on|off` still parses and logs any mob_id; this only tells the log
  whether the client itself flagged that mob_id as GM-switchable.

## Modules delivered (RE-089/090/091 follow-up round)

RE-089, RE-090 and RE-091 (`notes_to_chief/20260827_0016_...`,
`notes_to_chief/20260826_2346_...`, `notes_to_chief/20260826_2322_...`) all
came back since the previous round; this round reads and folds all three in
before building further, per this lane's own "ค้นก่อนถอด" rule.

- `gm/state_wire.py` docstring corrected: RE-089 disproves the `bm_gm.tga`
  "GM chat-balloon icon" lead this docstring used to cite (it is the
  `FxNumberCache` green-minus damage-number glyph, unrelated to GM) and
  answers CORE-REQUEST-GM-001 as DONE/BOUNDED-NEGATIVE -- state propagation
  into `GMModule_Client` is pinned, but no render/widget/UI consumer is
  found, so the three payload fields **stay opaque integers**, unchanged
  from round one. Nothing in the module's behaviour changes, only the
  citation.
- `gm/teleport_wire.py` (new, GM-003 support) -- encode/decode for
  `ForcePos`, `CWarpResult`, `TeleportVital` per the RE-090 pinned byte
  shape (wire-facts table above). Positional field names for everything
  RE-090 does not resolve semantically, same convention as
  `gm/command_wire.py`; `scene_id`/`scene_seq` keep the names already
  established elsewhere in this codebase because RE-077 already crosswalked
  those two. This closes the "no wire codec for the warp dependency" gap
  `gm/commands.py`'s scope note has named since round one -- `warp`
  **still does not execute**, this only means the bytes it would need to
  send now have a real, tested builder instead of not existing at all.
  Direction (which side sends `ForcePos`/`CWarpResult`) is still
  NOT_OBSERVED, so the module provides both an encoder and a decoder for
  each message and does not assume a side.
- RE-091 (PASS/DONE) settles a question this doc did not previously carry
  explicitly: the real client's `0x51E9` comes from a **dedicated GM
  editor widget** (Enter key, non-empty text, gated on that widget being
  active), not from a prefix check inside the normal chat box -- normal
  chat uses the unrelated `Channel_*MessageVital` family. This project's
  own design of interpreting arbitrary chat text as a GM command (see
  `gm/commands.py`'s scope note: this module "takes a plain `str`" and does
  not depend on 0x51E9 at all) is therefore **this lane's own policy
  choice**, not a reconstruction of original client behaviour -- stated
  here so a future round or reader does not cite RE-091 as proof our chat
  parsing matches the original client's dedicated-editor path. It does not.

## Modules delivered (dispatch/authorization-gate round)

The previous round (`rounds/GM_20260827_0438_...md`) named the missing
piece explicitly: `warp` (and every other GM-003 command) still cannot
execute because no inbound dispatch of 0x51E9 has ever existed in
`runtime.py`, and the authorization-gate decision in front of it is "bigger
than a one-line CORE-REQUEST letter" -- proposed as its own round rather
than rushed. This round is that round.

- `gm/dispatch.py` (new) -- `handle_gm_run_command_vital(account_name,
  raw_payload)`, the single function `CORE-REQUEST-GM-010` asks chief to
  wire at the point `runtime.py` reads vital id 0x51E9 off the wire. It
  checks `gm/accounts.is_gm_account()` FIRST, before any capture/decode
  side effect, reusing the exact "refuse by name, not by crash" pattern
  `runtime.py`'s own CORE-REQUEST-006 login check already uses for a
  malformed `gm_accounts.json` (same `(ValueError, OSError)` catch, same
  `gm_account_lookup_failed_<ExceptionType>` reason string). Only when the
  sender is an authorized GM does it call
  `command_capture.capture_raw_gm_command` (GM-002's existing sink); an
  unauthorized or misconfigured call writes nothing to disk. It does not
  decode the two wide strings into a `gm/commands.py` `GmCommand` and does
  not log via `log_gm_command` -- that mapping is still unproven (RE-088's
  own nonclaim), so bridging it here would be a guess this lane's rules
  forbid. It does not execute anything and does not send
  `GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` (0x8C77) -- no send path exists in this
  lane's write zone and the result byte's meaning is unproven regardless.
- `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py` (new, 11 tests) -- proves the
  authorization gate specifically: a missing config, a non-GM account, and
  a malformed config all refuse and write nothing; an authorized GM's call
  writes exactly one real capture file per call, matching
  `command_capture.py`'s own format.

`pf-adversary` (this round) found that `command_capture.py`'s hex-dump sink
has no size cap of its own, and this module is what makes that sink
reachable from a live wire for the first time -- a many-megabyte
`GM_RunGMCommandVital` payload from an authorized-but-hostile or scripted
GM client would block the handling thread for tens of seconds and could
fill disk per call. `dispatch.py` closes this with
`MAX_RAW_PAYLOAD_LENGTH` (64 KiB, far larger than any real
`GM_RunGMCommandVital` RE-088 has proven the shape of): a GM account
sending an oversized payload gets `authorized=True` (it IS a GM account)
but `captured_path=None` and `refusal_reason=REFUSAL_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` --
nothing is written to disk for that one call. The size check runs AFTER
the authorization check, so a non-GM sender's refusal reason stays
`REFUSAL_NOT_GM` regardless of payload size and never reveals the cap
exists.

The one thing this closes is the security gap the previous round flagged:
before this module, nothing in this package stopped any connected account
(GM or not -- RE-091 already proved the real client's own gate is a UI
widget, not a wire-level check) from making this lane write a capture file
to disk on demand, once wiring existed at all. This module is the gate that
must sit in front of any future wiring, not a new capability by itself --
warp/npc/item/lv/spawn/say still do not execute after this round, and no
account gets anything it could not already get from CORE-REQUEST-006's
existing login-time check.

## Modules delivered (warp-executor round)

- **new** `gm/warp_executor.py` -- `make_warp_force_pos_frame(legacy,
  vital_version, command, current_scene_id, z)`, the function
  `CORE-REQUEST-011` asks chief to wire at the point that would send a
  `warp` command's effect back to a GM connection. It bridges a parsed
  `warp` `GmCommand` (from `gm/commands.py`) into a real `ForcePos` frame
  (`gm/teleport_wire.py`, RE-090 PASS/DONE, zero unproven fields) -- but
  **only** the same-scene case: `ForcePos` carries no scene id field at
  all, so it cannot honor the scene-crossing half of what
  `warp <scene_id> x y` reads as. The caller must pass
  `current_scene_id` (the connection's real current scene; this module
  tracks no player state itself); if the command's own `scene_id` argument
  differs, or the command has no `x`/`y` at all (the scene-only
  `warp <scene_id>` form), the function raises `WarpExecutorError` instead
  of sending an in-scene hop for a command that asked to leave the scene --
  that would misrepresent what `ForcePos` actually did. `z` is a required
  parameter, not inferred, because the GM-003 grammar has no z argument.
  Cross-scene warp still needs `TeleportVital`, whose `target`/`aux`
  sub-objects carry several positional-only fields RE-090 leaves unproven
  (`field_0x10`, `field_0x11`, `field_0x18`, `field_0x20`, `field_0x22`,
  and most of `TeleportAux`) -- guessing values for those is exactly the
  invention this lane's nonclaim rule forbids, so this module refuses that
  case by name rather than attempting it.
- **new** `tests/test_gm_warp_executor.py` -- proves the same-scene frame
  matches the proven `ForcePos` codec byte-for-byte, and that every refusal
  path (non-warp command, scene-only form, differing `current_scene_id`)
  raises `WarpExecutorError` rather than returning a frame.
- **fixed** `gm/commands.py`'s module docstring, which still said executing
  `warp` "needs ... wiring that is not proven yet" -- stale since RE-090
  closed the `ForcePos` layout; corrected to point at `warp_executor.py`
  and state precisely what remains unbuilt (the scene-crossing case).

This module still does not send anything -- it returns frame bytes for a
caller to send. No account gets anything it could not already get before
this round; the visible effect of wiring `CORE-REQUEST-011` in is that a
GM connection already in the target scene can be repositioned within it.
Scene-crossing `warp`, `npc`, `item`, `lv`, and `spawn` still do not
execute after this round.

## Modules delivered (say-wire round)

- **new** `gm/say_wire.py` -- `make_say_broadcast_frame(legacy, command, *,
  speaker="")`, the function `CORE-REQUEST-012` asks chief to wire at
  whatever call site eventually produces a real `say` `GmCommand`. It
  bridges a parsed `say` command into a real `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital`
  (0x9F2C) frame by importing `channel_message_hypothesis.py`'s already-proven
  `make_channel_message_response` -- the exact fix the retracted
  broadcast-wire round (below) named as the required next step, and the
  reason this round did not write a second wire codec. `speaker` defaults to
  `""`, the value every captured GT-006 frame on this shared serializer has
  carried; a caller with a real GM display name may pass one.
- **new** `tests/test_gm_say_wire.py` -- proves the built frame matches
  `make_channel_message_response`'s own output byte-for-byte, round-trips
  through `channel_message_hypothesis.decode_channel_message`, and that
  `GM_GLOBAL_CHANNEL_ID` is the same object as
  `SHARED_SERIALIZER_CHANNEL_IDS["Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital"]` (no copy to
  drift). `pf-adversary` (this round) found two gaps against the
  "regardless of source" contract before this shipped: `gm/commands.py`'s
  480-char `MAX_SAY_MESSAGE_LENGTH` cap was enforced only inside
  `parse_gm_command`, so a hand-built `GmCommand` bypassed it entirely; and
  `command.args` was indexed with plain `len()`/`[0]`, leaking a bare
  `TypeError`/`KeyError`/`IndexError` instead of `SayWireError` for an
  `args` container of the wrong *shape* (`None`, a `set`, a `dict`), not
  just the wrong value. Both are fixed (the length cap is re-checked, and
  `len()`/indexing are wrapped) with 5 new regression tests.
- **known, deliberately not fixed this round**: `pf-adversary` confirmed
  `gm/warp_executor.py` has the identical args-shape gap (a `None`/`set`/
  `dict` `command.args` leaks a bare `TypeError` there too) -- it predates
  this round and is out of `say_wire.py`'s scope to fix. A follow-up round
  should apply the same `len()`/indexing guard there.

Like `warp_executor.py`, this module does not send anything -- it returns
frame bytes for a caller to send. `say` still does not execute after this
round: no account gets anything it could not already get before.

## Modules delivered (warp-executor args-shape follow-up round)

- **fixed** `gm/warp_executor.py`'s args-shape gap named as a known
  follow-up in the say-wire round above: `make_warp_force_pos_frame` now
  wraps `len(command.args)` and its three positional reads the same way
  `say_wire.py` already does, converting a shape-mismatched `args` (`None`,
  a `set`, a `dict`) into `WarpExecutorError` instead of a bare
  `TypeError`/`KeyError`.
- `pf-adversary` (this round) then found the `say_wire.py`-style three-type
  catch (`TypeError`/`KeyError`/`IndexError`) itself still leaves two gaps
  open, reproduced live: (a) a custom `__len__`/`__getitem__` raising
  anything outside those three types (e.g. `AttributeError`, `ValueError`)
  still leaked past `WarpExecutorError`, contradicting the module's own
  "every failure surfaces as `WarpExecutorError`" promise -- both guards now
  catch `Exception` broadly instead; (b) a `str`/`bytes` scalar of length 3
  (e.g. `"123"`) is not a crash at all -- it passes `len(args) == 3` and is
  positionally indexable, so it was silently read as a real
  `(scene_id, x, y)` tuple instead of being refused as the wrong container
  shape -- `args` is now rejected by `isinstance` before either guard runs.
  Both gaps also apply to `gm/say_wire.py`'s identical three-type catch;
  this round's write-zone fix only covers `warp_executor.py`, so
  `say_wire.py` carries the same two gaps as a known follow-up (see below).
- `tests/test_gm_warp_executor.py` -- 4 new tests: a `str` args scalar, a
  `bytes` args scalar, an `args` object whose `__len__` raises `ValueError`,
  and one whose `__getitem__` raises `AttributeError`. All four must raise
  `WarpExecutorError`, not the underlying bare exception.
- **known, deliberately not fixed this round**: `gm/say_wire.py` has the
  same two gaps this round found and fixed in `warp_executor.py` (narrow
  three-type catch instead of broad `Exception`; no `str`/`bytes` scalar
  guard on `args`, though `say_wire.py`'s own `arg_count != 1` check plus
  its `isinstance(body, str)` check on the extracted element happens to
  make the scalar case less exploitable there than in `warp_executor.py` --
  not independently re-verified this round). Out of this round's scope
  (`say_wire.py` was not touched); a follow-up round should apply the same
  broadened catch and scalar guard there.

## Modules delivered (say-wire args-shape follow-up round)

- **fixed, then re-fixed** `gm/say_wire.py`'s own copy of the args-shape
  gap named as a known follow-up above. First pass: `make_say_broadcast_frame`'s
  `len(args)`/`args[0]` guards were broadened to catch `Exception` instead
  of the narrow `TypeError`/`KeyError`/`IndexError` set, and `args` was
  rejected via `isinstance` if it was `str`/`bytes` -- the same blacklist
  shape `warp_executor.py`'s own follow-up round had applied to itself.
  `pf-adversary` broke that first pass the same day: an integer-keyed
  `dict` (e.g. `{0: "hello"}`) is exactly the "mapping" shape this
  document already names as one of the three canonical wrong shapes
  (`None`, a `set`, a `dict`), yet `len(d)` and `d[0]` both succeed
  normally for it -- no exception is ever raised, so neither the
  `str`/`bytes` guard nor the broad `except Exception` fires, and a
  hand-built `GmCommand` with such a dict silently built a real frame.
  The identical gap applies to `warp_executor.py`'s copy of the same
  blacklist (`{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}`).
- **root cause and final fix**: a blacklist of individually-discovered
  wrong shapes is unbounded against a field typed `tuple[str, ...]`
  (`gm/commands.py`'s `GmCommand.args` annotation) with exactly one
  legitimate shape. Both `gm/say_wire.py` and `gm/warp_executor.py` now
  assert that shape directly (`if not isinstance(args, tuple): raise
  <ModuleError>(...)`) before any `len()`/indexing runs at all, closing
  the whole class of gap at once -- dict of any key type, `str`/`bytes`,
  `bytearray`, `memoryview`, a `list`, a custom object -- rather than
  continuing to chase individual shapes that happen not to raise.
- `pf-adversary` reviewed the allowlist fix itself (second pass, same
  round) and reported it found no tuple-subclass or tuple-like object
  that both passes `isinstance(args, tuple)` and misbehaves downstream.
  **That specific claim was wrong, and a third pf-adversary pass
  (same round) reproduced the counter-example live within a minute**: a
  tuple *subclass* overriding `__len__` or `__getitem__` to raise
  something other than this module's own error type
  (`class EvilTuple(tuple): def __len__(self): raise RuntimeError(...)`)
  passes `isinstance(args, tuple)` cleanly, and `GmCommand` (a plain
  frozen dataclass, `gm/commands.py`, no `__post_init__` validation)
  places no obstacle in front of a hand-built one -- exactly the
  "regardless of source" threat model this module's own docstring
  already claims to defend against. The two `WeirdLen`/`WeirdGetitem`
  regression tests carried forward from the first pass kept passing
  throughout, but for the wrong reason: those objects are plain objects,
  not tuples, so `isinstance` rejects them before their dunders are ever
  called -- the len()/indexing-exception path itself had gone untested
  since the allowlist landed. Recorded here rather than quietly
  corrected, per this lane's own rule against letting a convenient,
  unverified claim stand as fact.
- **root cause and final fix (third pass)**: `isinstance(args, tuple)`
  admits any subclass; `type(args) is tuple` does not. Both modules now
  check the exact type, not an `isinstance` match -- a real `tuple`
  (never a subclass) can never raise on `len()`/indexing, so there is no
  dunder left to lie through, closing this without needing any
  try/except around `len()`/indexing at all.
- `tests/test_gm_say_wire.py` (`SayWireArgsShapeFollowUpTests`) and
  `tests/test_gm_warp_executor.py` (`WarpExecutorArgsShapeTests`): each
  gained tests for an integer-keyed dict, a `list`, a `bytearray`
  (second pass) and a tuple subclass with a lying `__len__` and one with
  a lying `__getitem__` (third pass), alongside the `str`/`bytes` scalar
  and weird-`__len__`/`__getitem__` tests the first pass already added.

No behavior change on the happy path -- a real one-element `args` tuple
carrying a `str` (or a real three-element `args` tuple for `warp`)
produces a byte-identical frame to before. `say`/`warp` still do not
execute after this round: these modules only return frame bytes, they
send nothing, and no account gets anything it could not already get
before this round (`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`CORE-REQUEST-012` are not wired
into `runtime.py`).

## Modules delivered (GM-005 login-scene-override round)

Built the fast half of `notes_to_chief/20260827_1425_PANYA-ORDER-GM-warp-to-other-maps-two-paths.md`
("ทาง ก") -- the owner asked to see a non-default map without needing the GM
in-game editor widget (still gated on `RE-104`) or cross-scene
`TeleportVital` ("ทาง ข", still gated on `RE-090`'s unproven field semantics
and `CORE-REQUEST-011`'s same-scene-only wiring).

- `gm/login_scene_override.py`: `get_login_scene_override(account_name,
  gm_accounts_config_path=None, login_scene_config_path=None)` returns a
  scene_id only when the account is BOTH listed in `gm/accounts.py`'s
  `gm_accounts` allowlist AND has an entry in its own
  `config/gm_login_scene.json`-style config (env override
  `PF_GM_LOGIN_SCENE_CONFIG`, same pattern as `gm/accounts.py`'s
  `PF_GM_ACCOUNTS_CONFIG`) naming a scene_id present in
  `gm/scene_catalog.py`'s 330-row committed table. Checked fresh on every
  call, not cached -- revoking an account from `gm_accounts.json` removes
  its override on the very next call, no restart needed. ~~Neither file
  alone can grant anything: an override entry for a non-GM account is
  inert.~~ **SUPERSEDED, round `ccc9wj` (2026-08-28): no longer true as a
  description of the whole function.** A second, independent standalone
  path was added that grants an override with NO `gm_accounts.json`
  membership at all -- see "Modules delivered (round `ccc9wj`, GT-110
  standalone login-scene safety fix)" below for the current, accurate
  contract. This paragraph is left in place, struck through rather than
  deleted, as the historical record of what this round actually shipped.
- `tests/test_gm_login_scene.py`: default-empty, gating (GM+entry / GM-no-
  entry / non-GM-with-entry / unlisted), malformed config (non-object top
  level, non-dict `gm_login_scene`, non-int scene_id, `bool`-as-int,
  unknown scene_id), and a revocation-takes-effect-immediately test.
- `pf-adversary` review (this round) tried to make a non-GM account produce
  a non-`None` result (homoglyphs, NFC/NFD unicode, whitespace/case
  variants, a malformed entry for a *different* account) and could not; it
  did find that a non-object top-level JSON (a bare list/string/null) raised
  `AttributeError` instead of the documented `ValueError` -- both this
  module and `gm/accounts.py` shared the same gap (`data.get(...)` called
  without first checking `data` is a `dict`). Fixed in both files this
  round, with a regression test added to both `test_gm_login_scene.py` and
  `test_gm_accounts.py`.
- **Known, accepted blast radius** (flagged by `pf-adversary`, not fixed):
  `load_login_scene_overrides` validates the whole config file eagerly, so
  one malformed entry (e.g. an operator typo for `other_gm`) raises for
  every account's lookup, not just the mistyped one. This matches
  `gm/accounts.py`'s own existing behavior (`load_gm_accounts` already
  fails the same way for a malformed `gm_accounts.json`), so it is not a
  new inconsistency, but it is a real forward risk once a login call site
  exists: see `CORE-REQUEST-GM-015` for the explicit note to whoever wires
  the call point.
- **Not built this round** (chief's write zone, `runtime.py`): the two call
  points the owner's order asks for -- (1) at login, resolve
  `get_login_scene_override(token)` and send that scene_id instead of the
  default start scene when it is not `None`; (2) assemble that scene's
  census from `Data\Scene\Save\bgXXXX\bgXXXX.npc` placements (via
  `gamedata/pf_decode_lua_npc.py`, already used for `bg0001` by lane A/B)
  plus lane B's hostile roster where one exists for that scene (`bg0015`
  has one per the order). See `CORE-REQUEST-GM-015`.

## Modules delivered (RE-105 vital-version-pin round)

`RE-105` closed the `[ASSUMED - awaiting RE]` gap `CORE-REQUEST-016` opened:
`gm/state_wire.py`'s `GM_UPDATE_STATE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` moves from
`None` to `0`, the exact value RE-105 traced through the client's generic
VitalData collection reader end to end. `runtime.py`'s call site (chief's
write zone, gated on this constant since `CORE-REQUEST-016`) needed no edit
-- the guard CORE-REQUEST-016 asked for exists precisely so this lane can
close the value inside its own write zone once RE pins it.

- `tests/test_gm_login_state_guard.py`: rewritten from "guard stays closed"
  to "guard is now open, at the exact byte RE-105 traced" -- a GM account's
  `GM_UPDATE_STATE_AFTER_LOGIN` action, driven through the real dispatcher,
  now asserts its `pc` bytes contain `12 19 5A 0B 00` (nested vital id
  `0x5A19` little-endian, tag `0x0B`, version `0`) and not `12 19 5A 0B 01`
  (the value GT-101 proved fatal), plus the outer envelope's separate
  protocol-version byte `08 04` is unchanged. A non-GM account stays
  unaffected. A third test patches the module constant back to `None` and
  proves the frame is withheld again -- the guard is a real conditional, not
  a permanent hardcode either direction.
- `tests/test_gm_dispatch.py`: its `CORE-REQUEST-006` dispatch test
  (`test_a_gm_account_gets_no_state_frame_while_the_version_guard_is_closed`)
  asserted the now-stale "no frame" behavior; renamed to
  `test_a_gm_account_gets_the_re105_pinned_state_frame` and updated to
  assert the frame IS present and the withheld-event is absent, matching the
  guard's new open state.
- Full `tests/test_gm_*.py` suite (206 tests) and the repo's broader
  `unittest discover` (3565 tests; the only failures are 18 pre-existing
  `ModuleNotFoundError: capstone` import errors in unrelated static-RE
  probes, not touched this round) both pass after this change.

nonclaim: this closes the wire-version byte only. `GM_UpdateGMStateVital`'s
three payload fields (`+0x14`/`+0x15`/`+0x18`) stay opaque integers, RE-089's
own open next step -- setting the version correctly does not mean the field
values this lane sends (`0, 0, 0`) mean anything, and does not by itself
prove any client-observable GM UI change. That still needs an attended
capture/observation session (`GT-101` rerun) this lane cannot run headless.

## Modules delivered (round `50x5xt`, pf-adversary follow-up)

A full-package `pf-adversary` pass over `gm/` (not tied to any single
change -- a standing-debt sweep, since GM-002's live wiring means this
package now handles real inbound bytes) found three issues, none of them a
non-GM account gaining anything -- the allowlist gate itself held under
every shape tried:

- **Fixed, HIGH -- `gm/dispatch.py`**: `handle_gm_run_command_vital` called
  `command_capture.capture_raw_gm_command` (a real `os.mkdir`/`os.open`/
  `os.write`) with no `try`/`except`. Since `CORE-REQUEST-010` wires this in
  "always on" with no surrounding guard in `runtime.py` either, an `OSError`
  from a full disk, a permission error, or `capture_root` colliding with an
  existing non-directory file would have propagated out of the handler and
  could have taken the connection-handling thread down for every player over
  ONE authorized GM command's capture write -- exactly the "refuse by name,
  not by crash" failure mode this module's own docstring already claimed to
  have closed (it had only closed it for the account-lookup call, not this
  one). Fixed by wrapping the call in `try`/`except OSError`, returning
  `GmDispatchOutcome(authorized=True, captured_path=None,
  refusal_reason="capture_write_failed_<ExceptionType>")` -- same shape as
  the existing `gm_account_lookup_failed_*`/`payload_too_large` refusals, so
  a caller already handling those handles this the same way with no new
  branch. New tests in `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py`: one forces a real
  `FileExistsError` by pointing `capture_root` at a path that already exists
  as a file, one mocks `capture_raw_gm_command` to raise a generic `OSError`
  directly.
- **Fixed, MEDIUM -- `gm/commands.py`**: `describe_warp_target`,
  `describe_npc_target`, and `log_gm_command` indexed or `list()`-ed
  `command.args` with no shape check -- the exact bug class
  `gm/warp_executor.py` and `gm/say_wire.py` already closed for their own
  `GmCommand` inputs (a blacklist defeated by an integer-keyed dict, then an
  `isinstance(args, tuple)` allowlist defeated by a tuple subclass lying
  through `__len__`/`__getitem__`), left open in this file because these
  three functions predate that fix and nobody re-swept this file when it
  landed. Concretely: a hand-built `GmCommand` with `args={0: "1", 1: "2",
  2: "3"}` used to make `log_gm_command` silently write `"args": [0, 1, 2]`
  (the dict's *keys*) into the forensic ndjson log instead of raising, and
  `args=None` raised a bare `TypeError` instead of a catchable
  module-specific error. Fixed with a shared `_require_args_tuple(args,
  min_length=N)` helper using the same `type(args) is not tuple` exact-type
  check (not `isinstance`) plus a length check, raising the new
  `GmCommandArgsError`, called at the top of all three functions. New tests
  in `tests/test_gm_commands.py` (`ArgsShapeGuardTests`) cover the dict, a
  `None`, a lying tuple subclass, and a too-short real tuple for each
  function, plus a regression test proving `log_gm_command` now records the
  real positional values, not dict keys.
- **Not fixed this round, MEDIUM, tracked below** -- no per-account rate
  limit on authorized capture writes. See "What is intentionally NOT built
  yet, and why" below for why this is deferred rather than rushed.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 215/215 (up from 189 -- 26 new tests, all from this
round). Repo-wide `unittest discover`: 3587 tests, 18 pre-existing
`capstone`-import errors only (same set as every prior round's baseline),
no new failures.

nonclaim: none of this changes what any command *does* -- `warp`/`say`
still only return frame bytes to a caller, nothing is sent to a socket, and
no field semantics changed. This round is pure robustness/correctness
inside this lane's own write zone; no wire fact, no RE citation, and no
`runtime.py` edit involved.

## Modules delivered (round `kzwdle`, rate-limit + collision-loop bound)

Closes the two items round `50x5xt` deferred (see the struck-through bullet
under "What is intentionally NOT built yet, and why" below).

- **`gm/dispatch.py`**: `handle_gm_run_command_vital` now enforces a
  sliding-window per-account rate limit before the payload-size check --
  `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS_PER_WINDOW = 20` calls per
  `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS = 5.0`. A rate-limited call keeps
  `authorized=True` (the account really is GM) with `captured_path=None`
  and the new `refusal_reason=REFUSAL_RATE_LIMITED` -- same outcome shape
  as the existing oversized-payload and capture-write-failure refusals, so
  a caller already handling those needs no new branch. State
  (`_rate_limit_call_history`, one list of call timestamps per account) is
  process-global and lock-guarded; `reset_rate_limit_state_for_tests()`
  clears it for test isolation. The default is deliberately generous:
  `GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`'s GT-103 capture-matrix procedure paces attended
  sends 3 seconds apart (at most ~2 per 5-second window), an order of
  magnitude under the cap, so ordinary attended use is never refused --
  this is a flood guard against a scripted client, not a per-command
  throttle on a human.
- **`gm/command_capture.py`**: the filename collision retry loop (flagged
  by the same round's verify-pass as a companion liveness gap, not an
  uncaught-exception risk on its own) is now bounded by
  `_MAX_FILENAME_COLLISION_ATTEMPTS = 1000`; exceeding it raises `OSError`
  instead of spinning, which `gm/dispatch.py`'s existing `except OSError`
  around this call already turns into a `capture_write_failed_*` refusal
  -- no new refusal reason needed for this half.
- **`pf-adversary` (this round, verify pass)** found and this round fixed
  a real ordering gap in the first draft of the rate limiter before it
  ever left draft: the clock read (`time.time()`) originally happened
  *before* acquiring `_rate_limit_lock`, so two threads for the same
  account could race the lock and record their timestamps out of the
  order they were read in -- reproduced live with real threads, no clock
  mocking. The prune loop's `while history and history[0] <= cutoff:
  history.pop(0)` silently assumed ascending insertion order; an
  out-of-order `append` could leave an individually-expired entry
  unpruned behind a newer one until that newer entry also aged out.
  Self-healing, never a bypass (the account was held at its cap *longer*
  than the window, never let through early) -- but a real deviation from
  the documented window, and reproducible by ordinary thread scheduling
  jitter, not just a clock anomaly. Fixed by construction, not
  convention: the clock is now read *inside* the same lock (removing the
  race for every production caller, none of which passes an explicit
  `now_ts`), and insertion uses `bisect.insort` instead of `append` (so
  the history list stays sorted even for an explicit, intentionally
  out-of-order `now_ts` from a test, or a wall clock that steps
  backward). `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py`'s
  `test_an_out_of_order_now_ts_is_still_pruned_correctly` reproduces the
  exact shape (a later timestamp recorded before an earlier one) and
  proves the fix holds without needing real threads.
- `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py`: 10 new tests -- calls up to the
  window max succeed, the call past it is refused without touching the
  capture root, the window slides (a call after it elapses succeeds
  again), rate limiting is scoped per account not global, a refused
  non-GM call never consumes a GM account's own budget, `reset_rate_
  limit_state_for_tests()` actually clears history, the shipped (not
  test-overridden) defaults survive a realistic same-second burst, and
  the out-of-order-timestamp regression test above.
  `tests/test_gm_run_command_dispatch_wiring.py` and
  `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py` both now reset rate-limit state in
  `setUp` for defensive test isolation (the state is process-global,
  shared even across test files in the same `unittest discover` run).
  `tests/test_gm_command_capture.py`: 2 new tests -- the collision loop
  gives up after its bound instead of spinning (mocked `os.open` always
  raising `FileExistsError`, patched bound of 3, exactly 4 attempts made),
  and a realistic 50-capture same-second burst is unaffected by the bound.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 225/225 (up from 215 -- 12 new tests: 10 dispatch +
2 capture; two existing test files gained a defensive `setUp` reset with
no new test methods). Repo-wide `unittest discover`: 3619 tests, 18
pre-existing `capstone`-import errors only (same baseline every prior
round reports), no new failures.

nonclaim: pure robustness/correctness inside this lane's own write zone --
no command behavior changed on the happy path (`warp`/`say`/`npc`/`item`/
`lv`/`spawn` still only parse/log/build frame bytes, nothing is sent to a
socket), no wire fact, no RE citation, and no `runtime.py` edit involved.
The rate limiter changes when an already-authorized GM's capture gets
written, never who is authorized -- a non-GM account still gets exactly
nothing, same as every prior round.

## Modules delivered (round `fmgvbx`, RE-113 trailing-mask fix)

- **`gm/state_wire.py`**: `make_gm_update_state_frame` now builds the
  `0x5A19` frame via the legacy bridge's plural `make_runtime_vitals()`
  helper (a single-item list) instead of the singular `make_runtime_vital()`
  helper. The singular helper does not append the trailing derived-class
  change-mask byte (`u8tag(0x0B, 0)`) that `GSCN_RunTimeProtocolRes` v4
  requires after its VitalData collection; `GT-107` (attended) measured the
  client throwing `ErrorData=28317` and closing the socket immediately after
  receiving exactly the frame the singular helper produces. `RE-113` traces
  this to the plural helper's own pre-existing code comment (citing this
  same error code) and to three independent prior incidents documented in
  `reports/PF_DELETE_SOFT002_NATURAL_0x36DB_DECODE_20260818.md` Sec.(c) --
  not a new disassembly finding, a pattern this codebase had already hit and
  fixed elsewhere that this lane's own frame builder had not picked up.
  Output shape is otherwise unchanged: same three fields, same tags, same
  `vital_version`; the only wire difference is one trailing `0x0B 0x00`.
- `tests/test_gm_state_wire.py`: `test_frame_carries_the_gm_update_state_vital_id`
  updated to compare against `make_runtime_vitals()` instead of the old
  `make_runtime_vital()`; new regression test
  `test_frame_carries_the_re113_trailing_change_mask_byte` asserts the built
  PC's last two bytes are the trailing change-mask tag, so a future
  regression back to the singular helper fails loudly here instead of
  waiting for another attended GT to notice.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 232/232 (up from 225 -- 6 new assertions in the one
new test plus the updated existing one; no other test file touched).
`tests/test_gm_login_state_guard.py`'s end-to-end login test is unaffected
by this change (it does not assert on the trailing bytes), but is a
separate, already-known casualty of `CORE-REQUEST-020` (below) once that
lands, not of this fix.

nonclaim: this closes the specific `ErrorData=28317` failure mode `RE-113`
traced -- it does not itself prove a real client accepts the corrected
frame (that needs an attended GT rerun), and it does not touch
`field_0x0b_second`'s value (still `0`, unproven-but-safe pending
`CORE-REQUEST-020`) or any other field semantics. Wire/DB evidence only,
no client-observable claim from this lane's own testing this round.

## Modules delivered (round `dnh0ai`, pf-adversary sweep of newer modules)

`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` stay blocked (the two-wide-string semantic gap in
`GM_RunGMCommandVital` still needs a live capture, `GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`
GT-103 -- see "RE requests open" below, unchanged this round), so this
round's own write-zone work is a full `pf-adversary` pass over every `gm/`
module added since round `50x5xt`'s sweep (`say_wire.py`, `teleport_wire.py`,
`warp_executor.py`, `npc_switch_catalog.py`, `login_scene_override.py`) plus
a re-check of the whole package.

- **`gm/commands.py`**: `describe_warp_target`/`describe_npc_target` checked
  `command.args`'s *shape* via `_require_args_tuple` (the round `50x5xt` fix)
  but then called bare `int(args[0])`/`int(args[1])` with no
  `try`/`except` -- a shape-valid tuple with non-numeric content
  (`GmCommand("warp", ("abc",), "warp abc")`) crashed with an uncaught
  `ValueError` instead of this module's own `GmCommandArgsError`, directly
  contradicting the "regardless of source" contract `GmCommandArgsError`'s
  own docstring states. Not reachable from any live path today (`grep -rn
  "describe_warp_target|describe_npc_target" src/` -- called only from this
  module's own tests, not yet wired into `runtime.py`/`lane_hooks/`), but
  latent: the moment a future round bridges the still-unmapped `0x51E9` wide
  strings (RE-091) into a `GmCommand` that skips `parse_gm_command`, this
  was going to be exactly the crash it hit. Fixed with a new
  `_require_arg_int` helper (mirrors `_require_int`'s error message, raises
  `GmCommandArgsError` not `GmCommandParseError` -- the args-shape family,
  since this is the "regardless of source" path, not the parse-from-text
  path).
- No other finding: rate limiter, filename-collision loop, wire codec
  round-trips (`command_wire.py`, `teleport_wire.py`), fail-closed
  authorization (`accounts.py`/`dispatch.py`/`login_scene_override.py`), and
  the two committed data-table SHA pins (`scene_catalog.py`,
  `npc_switch_catalog.py`) were all specifically tried against and held.
- `tests/test_gm_commands.py`: 2 new tests in `ArgsShapeGuardTests` --
  `describe_warp_target`/`describe_npc_target` each reject a shape-valid,
  content-invalid tuple with `GmCommandArgsError`.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 234/234 (up from 232 -- the 2 new tests above).
Repo-wide `pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`: 3536 passed, 212
skipped, 17 pre-existing `capstone`-import collection errors only (same
baseline every prior round reports, confirmed unrelated by inspection --
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'capstone'`, not a `gm/` import), no
new failures.

nonclaim: pure robustness fix inside this lane's own write zone -- the bug
was unreachable from any live path before this fix and still is after it
(no caller of `describe_warp_target`/`describe_npc_target` exists yet); no
wire fact, no RE citation, no `runtime.py` edit, no command's happy-path
behavior changed. This round sent no frame and ran no game test.

## Modules delivered (round `3a0tly`, literal byte-tail regression proof)

`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` stay blocked (unchanged since round `dnh0ai` / chief's
2026-08-27T22:00+07:00 reply), and GT-103 (the command-wire capture matrix)
stays `[PENDING]` on an attended runner. An attended-session nudge
(`pf_bridge/notes_to_chief/20260827_2305_KA1A-NUDGE-*.md`) pointed out this
lane had real write-zone work available anyway: both fixes needed for the
next login-state attended attempt (RE-113's trailing change-mask byte, round
`fmgvbx`; `CORE-REQUEST-020`'s `field_0x0b_second=1`, confirmed on main R198/
R199) had landed, but no test asserted the exact literal byte tail those two
fixes together are supposed to produce -- the two existing
`tests/test_gm_login_state_guard.py` tests both compare the dispatcher's
output against `state_wire.make_gm_update_state_frame`, the same function
`runtime.py`'s real call site uses, so a bug inside that shared function
could pass both sides identically and slip through.

- **`tests/test_gm_login_state_guard.py`**: one new test,
  `test_the_re113_plus_core_request_020_frame_matches_a_literal_hex_tail`.
  Drives a GM-account login through the real dispatcher (same harness as the
  file's other two tests) and asserts the frame's tail against a
  hand-written, byte-by-byte literal -- not computed from any function under
  test:
  ```
  12 19 5A  0B 00  0B 00  0B 01  14 00 00 00 00  0B 00
  ```
  (`u16tag(0x12, 0x5A19)` vital id LE; `u8tag(0x0B, 0)` RE-105's confirmed
  version; `field_0x0b_first=0`; `field_0x0b_second=1` per CORE-REQUEST-020;
  `u32tag(0x14, 0)` `field_0x14`; RE-113's trailing `u8tag(0x0B, 0)`
  change-mask byte). No production code changed -- this is a regression-proof
  addition only.
- `tests/test_gm_*.py`: 235/235 (up from 234). Repo-wide
  `pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`: 3586 passed, 212 skipped,
  17 pre-existing `capstone`-import collection errors only (same baseline
  every prior round reports), no new failures.
- `pf_bridge/GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`: opened `GT-107-R3`, the attended session
  that fires this exact frame at a real client for the first time since the
  two fixes landed -- see `pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0022_*.md` for the
  full letter. `GT-107`'s own header corrected from a stale `[PENDING]` to
  reflect its actual negative result (error 28317, superseded by `GT-107-R3`).

nonclaim: headless-only round. No frame was fired at a real client. The
literal byte tail above is what the dispatcher assembles today, proven at the
Python level only -- whether a real client accepts it, and whether the
`BT_GM` button actually renders, are exactly the two questions `GT-107-R3`
exists to answer and this round does not claim either one.

## Attempted and retracted (broadcast-wire round)

This round tried to give `say` a wire codec for `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital`
(0x9F2C), reading only `pf_bridge/external/PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv`
(`UNTAGGED_WSTRING16LE_LEN32LE`, no tag byte) and `PF_FIELD_VALIDATION.tsv`
(one real R-direction frame). A `pf-adversary` pass (three rounds: initial
review, fix-verify, a final targeted check) eventually caught what the first
two passes did not: this repository's own `reports/
PF_CHAT_CHANNEL001_CHANNEL_FAMILY_AND_ROUTING_STATIC_20260818.md` and
`src/pirateforce_foundation/channel_message_hypothesis.py` already prove a
**different, tag-prefixed** wire shape for this exact message (`tag 0x48 +
u32 byte-length + UTF-16LE`, not the untagged shape this round built) --
corroborated against real captured frames, not merely a static table row.
The draft codec this round wrote would have produced bytes the real client
almost certainly does not accept.

**Root cause: this round's "ค้นก่อนถอด" search never covered this
repository's own `reports/`, `docs/`, or sibling `src/` modules** -- only
`pf_bridge/external/` and `pf_bridge/gamedata/`, per the letter that opened
this lane. That letter's search scope is right for client-binary facts but
was wrongly treated as the *entire* search obligation; a working,
better-proven implementation was sitting in this same repository the whole
time. The draft module (`gm/broadcast_wire.py`) and its tests were deleted
rather than committed, once found to be wrong -- see the corrected wire-facts
table row above for what actually holds.

**For any future round**: `say`'s wire needs are already met by
`channel_message_hypothesis.py` (`SHARED_SERIALIZER_CHANNEL_IDS
["Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital"] = 0x9F2C`, field order `speaker`/`body`
proven). Bridge `gm/commands.py`'s parsed `say` `GmCommand` to that module's
existing encode function via import -- do not write a second codec in this
lane's zone. That module's own docstring notes its dispatch is currently
opt-in/`test_only: true` behind a scenario allowlist, not wired to any live
connection by default -- coordinate with whichever lane owns it (CHAT-ECHO/
CHAT-CHANNEL work, chief round 76) before importing, the same courtesy
GM-003's own "reuse via import, never copy" rule already asks for `world_
scene_travel.py`/`field_mob_tables.py`.

## What is intentionally NOT built yet, and why

- `state_wire` IS wired into the login path as of `CORE-REQUEST-006`
  (round R180, `runtime.py` ~line 4353): after a successful login, if
  `is_gm_account()` is true and `state_wire.
  GM_UPDATE_STATE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` is not `None` (`CORE-REQUEST-016`'s
  guard), `make_gm_update_state_frame` is called with that constant as the
  version and the resulting frame is queued to that connection, no scenario
  flag. `is_gm_account()` failures are refused-by-name (login proceeds with
  no GM frame) so a config typo cannot take down the listener thread for
  every player -- see the comment at the call site.
  **UPDATED (round `kcm8ir`): the version is no longer an unproven
  placeholder.** This section used to say the call passed a hardcoded `1`
  tagged `[ASSUMED - awaiting RE]` -- `GT-101` (attended) proved that exact
  byte kills the session on a real client (modal `ErrorData=23065`), and
  `RE-105` (STATIC-ON-BRIDGE, DONE/PASS) then pinned the correct value as
  `0`. `GM_UPDATE_STATE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` is `0` now, not `None` and
  not `1` -- see "RE requests closed" item 5 and "Modules delivered (RE-105
  vital-version-pin round)" below for the full trail. Do not re-hardcode `1`
  here or at the call site; that is the byte GT-101 measured as fatal.
  The three payload fields (`0, 0, 0`) are a separate, still-open question:
  `RE-089 GM-STATE-VISUAL-001` came back **DONE/BOUNDED-NEGATIVE** (see
  wire-facts table): it pins the propagation path but finds no render/UI
  consumer, so it answers CORE-REQUEST-GM-001 without unblocking a semantic
  rename. What still needs to resolve real semantics is a capture/attended
  matrix (RE-089's own stated next step), not yet opened.
- No command *execution* path wired to a live connection (see
  `gm/commands.py` scope note above). `gm/teleport_wire.py` gives `warp` a
  real, tested byte builder for `ForcePos`/`CWarpResult`/`TeleportVital`,
  `gm/warp_executor.py` bridges the same-scene case into a ready `ForcePos`
  frame, `gm/say_wire.py` (this round) bridges `say` into a ready
  `Channel_GMGlobalMessageVital` frame, and `gm/dispatch.py` gives 0x51E9 an
  inbound authorization gate and a real capture sink. `CORE-REQUEST-010`
  (that last piece) **is wired and merged to `main`** as of chief round R190
  (`pirate-force-server@dfa61ac`, confirmed an ancestor of `main` this round
  via `git merge-base --is-ancestor`; `runtime.py`'s
  `GM_RUN_GM_COMMAND_VITAL_ID` branch, always on, no scenario flag) -- it
  counts and authorizes/refuses every inbound 0x51E9 frame and writes a
  capture file (`capture/gm_command_capture/`, see `gm/command_capture.py`)
  for authorized ones, but still does not decode the two wide strings into a
  `GmCommand` and sends no reply, so no command source exists yet that could
  drive `warp_executor.py`/`say_wire.py` from a real client. Because this
  path is now live on `main`, GM-002's attended capture matrix (real GM
  account, real client, real 0x51E9 frames landing in that capture
  directory) is runnable for the first time this round -- see
  `GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md` GT-103's GM-002 entry (filed this round). Sending
  anything
  *to* a socket still needs a runtime send path outside this lane's write
  zone, so execution stays not-built until `CORE-REQUEST-011` (same-scene
  warp) and `CORE-REQUEST-012` (say broadcast) -- both proposed, neither
  wired yet -- and a future `CORE-REQUEST-GM-<nnn>` (everything else) land.
  Even once wired, `CORE-REQUEST-011` only covers `warp` when the target
  scene_id matches the connection's current scene -- scene-crossing `warp`,
  `npc`, `item`, `lv`, and `spawn` all still need work beyond this round
  (spawn and cross-scene warp need RE the lane does not have yet;
  `npc`/`item`/`lv` need write access to player/world state in
  `runtime.py`). Separately, the wide-string field mapping in
  `GM_RunGMCommandVital` still needs to be proven enough to bridge real
  client input into `gm/commands.py`'s
  grammar -- `warp_executor.py` takes an already-parsed `GmCommand`
  regardless of source, same policy choice `gm/commands.py` itself makes.
- No general lane-A scene registry or lane-B mob roster reuse in
  `gm/commands.py`. Both lanes' current modules
  (`world_scene_travel.py`, `field_mob_tables.py`) are single-destination /
  single-scene, not general id->data lookups; importing them for a generic
  multi-scene `warp`/`spawn` command would misrepresent what they actually
  cover. `gm/scene_catalog.py` (this lane's own, from committed gamedata) is
  used only as a non-blocking name hint for `warp`, never as proof a warp
  target is reachable.
- ~~No per-account rate limit on authorized `0x51E9` capture writes~~ --
  **closed round `kzwdle`**, see "Modules delivered (round `kzwdle`,
  rate-limit + collision-loop bound)" below. `gm/dispatch.py` now enforces
  `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS_PER_WINDOW` per account per
  `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`, and `gm/command_capture.py`'s filename
  collision retry loop is bounded (`_MAX_FILENAME_COLLISION_ATTEMPTS`)
  instead of unbounded. No `CORE-REQUEST` was needed -- both fixes are
  fully inside this lane's own write zone.

## Nonclaim rule

Every PR and every attended test entry that uses a GM shortcut states, in
one line, which step the shortcut skipped, e.g.:

> nonclaim: reached the target scene via GM warp; this does not exercise or
> claim the player-driven travel/scene-load path.

## RE requests closed

1. `GM_RunGMCommandVital` (`0x00729E10`/`0x00726C20`): **CLOSED structurally
   by RE-088** (one presence flag, one nested body, no proven sub-opcode --
   see wire-facts table). `GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` (`0x00729790`): the
   single u8 result field at `+0x14` is proven positionally (RE-088).
2. `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` handler `0x00729F00`: **CLOSED
   DONE/BOUNDED-NEGATIVE by RE-089**. Byte/byte/u32 propagation into
   `GMModule_Client` is pinned; `bm_gm.tga` is disproven as a GM indicator
   (it is an unrelated damage-number glyph). No render/UI consumer found --
   field semantics stay unproven pending a capture/attended matrix, which
   RE-089 names as the next step but does not itself open.
3. `TeleportVital` / `ForcePos` / `CWarpResult` field layout: **CLOSED
   PASS/DONE by RE-090**, T0-T3 all closed including optional
   `TeleportCheckVital`. See wire-facts table; codec in
   `gm/teleport_wire.py`. Natural network direction for `ForcePos`/
   `CWarpResult` is not part of what RE-090 proves and stays open if it
   matters later.
4. Chat input -> 0x51E9 trigger condition: **CLOSED PASS/DONE by RE-091**.
   The real client's trigger is a dedicated GM editor widget (Enter, non-
   empty text), not a prefix check on normal chat; normal chat is a
   separate `Channel_*MessageVital` family with no prefix branch to
   0x51E9 anywhere in its 365-byte CFG. This project's own chat-text-as-
   GM-command design (`gm/commands.py`) is a policy choice this result does
   not validate or invalidate -- see "Modules delivered (RE-089/090/091
   follow-up round)" above.
5. `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` (`0x5A19`) wire version: **CLOSED DONE/PASS by
   RE-105**
   (`notes_to_chief/20260827_1613_RE-105-RESULT-VITAL-VERSION-ZERO-GENERIC-MISMATCH-PATH.md`).
   The generic VitalData collection reader (`[0x005F3E20,0x005F406D)`) does
   an exact-equality compare against `message+0x10`, and the `0x5A19`
   prototype's own bootstrap constructor stores that byte as `0` directly --
   not inferred from any other vital. `gm/state_wire.py`'s
   `GM_UPDATE_STATE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` is now pinned to `0` (was `None`
   since `CORE-REQUEST-016`); `runtime.py`'s call site is unchanged code
   (still gated on that constant), so this closes purely inside this lane's
   write zone -- no new `CORE-REQUEST` needed. See "Modules delivered
   (RE-105 vital-version-pin round)" below for the byte-level proof.
6. GM editor widget open/toggle trigger: **CLOSED PASS/DONE by RE-104**
   (`notes_to_chief/20260827_1518_RE-104-RESULT-BT-GM-MODULE-PLUS19-GATE.md`).
   The trigger is UI resource `BT_GM`, shown/enabled from connection query
   type `0x25` returning `GMModule_Client+0x19`; click re-checks the same
   gate, then opens dedicated panel `GMUI_BASIC` (`Radiobutton_Message` +
   `TextBox_Message`, Enter to send -- the producer RE-091 already proved).
   No screen coordinate or icon texture is claimed; this closes the *trigger
   mechanism* only. Static corpus gives no evidence either way on whether a
   non-GM account can see the `BT_GM` control -- that stays an open question
   for a real capture/attended matrix, same as `GM_UpdateGMStateVital`'s
   three field meanings below.
7. `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` (`0x5A19`) `GSCN_RunTimeProtocolRes` envelope,
   `ErrorData=28317`: **CLOSED PASS/DONE by RE-113** (round `fmgvbx`,
   `pf_bridge/CLIENT_RE_QUEUE.md`). Not a field-layout defect in the vital
   itself -- `gm/state_wire.py` built the frame via the legacy bridge's
   singular `make_runtime_vital()` helper, which omits a trailing
   derived-class change-mask byte (`u8tag(0x0B, 0)`) that
   `GSCN_RunTimeProtocolRes` v4 requires after its VitalData collection; the
   sibling `make_runtime_vitals()` helper appends it and already carries a
   comment citing this exact error code, independently corroborated three
   times in `reports/PF_DELETE_SOFT002_NATURAL_0x36DB_DECODE_20260818.md`
   Sec.(c). Fixed this round -- see "Modules delivered (round `fmgvbx`,
   RE-113 trailing-mask fix)" below. Residual bounded-negative: no single
   client-binary instruction address was found for the trailing-byte read
   itself (the proof rests on the legacy bridge's own code comment plus the
   committed report's wire/behavioral precedent, not a fresh disassembly of
   this exact continuation) -- does not block closure.

## RE requests open (owned by static RE lane, filed via chief)

None filed by this lane are open as of round `4djeqi`.

`RE-118` (round `y2nhzz`, `pf_bridge/CLIENT_RE_QUEUE.md`) is now **CLOSED
PASS/DONE** (round `4djeqi`,
`notes_to_chief/20260828_0411_RE-118-RESULT-CURRENT-UI-KEY-MUST-BE-NONEMPTY.md`):
the click chain from `BT_GM` uses only the existing `GMModule_Client+0x19`
gate (`+0x18`/`+0x1C` are read by an unrelated adapter, not this click path
-- do not tweak them). After that gate passes, dispatcher `0x00AA0710`
requires a non-null current-UI object whose vfunc `+0x04` returns a
non-empty UTF-16 key; when the key is empty, factory `0x007280D0` is never
reached and nothing is logged -- exactly the silent no-window/no-frame
outcome `GT-107-R3` observed. No new field on `0x5A19` needed. Static
cannot say whether the key was actually empty during that specific run, so
`GT-103` now carries an attended A/B step (click from an empty HUD vs. click
after opening a panel known to give a non-empty current-UI key,
`pf_bridge/GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`) instead of staying blocked.

RE-088, RE-089, RE-090, RE-091, RE-104, RE-105, RE-113, and RE-118 are all
closed (see above) -- kept here so the next round does not have to
re-derive that from the closed list.

Remaining semantic gaps (what the
`GM_RunGMCommandVital` two wide strings and three scalars mean; what the
`GM_RunGMCommandResultVital` byte means; what `GM_UpdateGMStateVital`'s
three fields mean; what the `TeleportVital`/`CWarpResult` positional-only
fields mean; natural direction for `ForcePos`/`CWarpResult`) all need real
captured frames, not more static reading. `PF_FIELD_VALIDATION.tsv` is
NOT_OBSERVED (zero frames) for `ForcePos`/`CWarpResult` and for every other
message named above -- `TeleportVital` is the one exception, already noted
in the wire-facts table: 132 candidate frames per direction at
`A2_STATIC_OPEN` (candidate-matched, not parse-confirmed), so those bytes
exist to check field meaning and the `TeleportTarget` field-order caveat
against, they just have not been run through this codec yet. That check
(and everything else in this list) is attended-test / capture territory
(GM-002), not a new RE ticket, until this lane has a build that can
generate or observe one of these messages live.

## Modules delivered (round `w8t8vi`, one level deeper than the args-shape hardening)

`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` stay blocked (unchanged), and `GT-103`/`GT-107-R3`
stay `[PENDING]` on an attended runner -- nothing new to report on either.
This round instead ran the lane's own recurring `pf-adversary` sweep of
`gm/` and found a real gap in a bug class the lane's docstrings otherwise
describe as closed: every prior round hardened the `GmCommand.args`
*container* shape (`type(args) is not tuple`, broad `except Exception`), but
three call sites still only guarded the individual scalar *conversion* one
step deeper with `except (TypeError, ValueError)`, which a hand-built
element's `__int__`/`__float__` can raise past (an `AttributeError`, a
`KeyError`, anything else) -- exactly the same "hand this module a
`GmCommand` regardless of source" threat model, one field further in.

- **`gm/warp_executor.py`** `_require_int`/`_require_finite_float`: now
  catch `Exception` broadly, matching the container-shape guard already
  above them in the same module.
- **`gm/commands.py`** `_require_arg_int` (used by `describe_warp_target`/
  `describe_npc_target`): same fix, same reasoning.
- **`gm/commands.py`** `log_gm_command`: a shape-valid `args` tuple holding
  a JSON-non-serializable element used to create the log directory and open
  the file for append *before* `json.dumps` ran, so a rejected call still
  left an empty file/directory behind -- violating the sibling
  shape-rejection test's own "writes nothing on rejection" contract for
  this different failure mode. `json.dumps` now runs before any filesystem
  mutation; only a successfully serialized line reaches `mkdir`/`open`.
- `tests/test_gm_*.py`: 240/240 (up from 235, five new regression tests: two
  in `test_gm_warp_executor.py`, three in `test_gm_commands.py`). No
  production behavior changed for any input that was already valid -- these
  three call sites still return the same value for every input that used to
  succeed; only the exception type/no-write guarantee changed for inputs
  that were always supposed to be refused.

nonclaim: headless-only round, no code outside `gm/`/`tests/gm_*` touched,
no frame fired at a real client, no `runtime.py` edit. Full detail:
`pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0127_args-shape-hardening-one-level-deeper.md`.

## Modules delivered (round `ccc9wj`, GT-110 standalone login-scene safety fix)

Answers `notes_to_chief/20260827_2240_KA1A-NOTE-GT110-unsafe-until-0x5A19-payload-fixed-plus-M1P-jobs-staged.md`:
`GT-110` (attended test of the login-scene override) required
`gm_accounts.json` membership, which makes `is_gm_account()` true, which
makes `runtime.py` send `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` (`0x5A19`) on login -- the
frame that killed `GT-101`/`GT-107` two different ways, one fix (`RE-113`)
landed but **not yet attended-reverified** (`GT-107-R3` still `[PENDING]`).
Running `GT-110` the old way risked a third crash for a question the ticket
never needed to ask.

- `gm/login_scene_override.py`: `get_login_scene_override` now checks TWO
  independent paths, either sufficient alone, both fresh every call, never
  cached: (1) the existing GM-gated path, unchanged; (2) a new
  **standalone** path (`load_standalone_login_scene_overrides`, config key
  `standalone_login_scene`, default `config/gm_login_scene_standalone.json`,
  env override `PF_GM_LOGIN_SCENE_STANDALONE_CONFIG`) that never calls
  `is_gm_account()` and never touches `gm_accounts.json` -- an account
  listed there gets a login scene_id and NOTHING else; it cannot become
  `is_gm_account()==True` through this path, so `runtime.py`'s
  `CORE-REQUEST-016`-gated `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` block never fires for
  it. `[สมมติของสาย GM - รอ COO ยืนยัน]`: this changes the module's own
  previously-stated security contract ("neither file alone can grant
  anything") -- see the struck-through paragraph above and
  `notes_to_chief/20260828_0222_LANE-GM-ASK-COO-standalone-login-scene-override-path.md`.
  Not built by touching `runtime.py`: the existing `CORE-REQUEST-015` call
  site (`get_login_scene_override(self.token)`) already routes through this
  function, so the new path activates at the existing wiring point with no
  core-file edit.
- `tests/test_gm_login_scene.py`: +7 tests for the standalone path
  (missing-file, grant-with-zero-`gm_accounts.json`-membership,
  gated-path-still-wins-with-**differing** scene_ids so the precedence
  assertion is actually load-bearing, unlisted-gets-none, malformed config,
  unknown scene_id). The original version of the precedence test used the
  *same* scene_id for both paths -- `pf-adversary` (round `ccc9wj`) built a
  deliberately-broken reimplementation that checks the standalone path
  first and showed it still passed that test; fixed by giving the two paths
  different scene_ids so a precedence regression cannot ship green.
- `tests/test_gm_login_scene_override_wiring.py`: +3 tests through the REAL
  dispatcher (not just the module in isolation) -- a GM-gated account gets
  both the override AND a `GM_UPDATE_STATE_AFTER_LOGIN` action (contrast
  case); a standalone-only account gets the override with that action
  **absent** from `state.dispatch()`'s own return value (the core safety
  claim, proven end to end, not just read from the source); a
  standalone-listed account still returns `is_gm_account() == False`.
  `pf-adversary` (round `ccc9wj`) flagged that the original version of this
  round's change had no dispatcher-level proof of the safety claim at all --
  these three tests close that gap.
- `GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`: `GT-110`'s server args, pre-boot grep checks, pass
  criteria (added: no `GM_UPDATE_STATE_AFTER_LOGIN` line anywhere in the
  session, or FAIL regardless of what the screen shows), teardown, and
  nonclaims all rewritten for the standalone path; the ticket no longer
  waits on `GT-107-R3`.
- `tests/test_gm_*.py`: 250/250 green(cloud sanity) (240 before this round +
  7 offline standalone-path tests + 3 dispatcher-level wiring tests), no
  regression.

nonclaim: headless-only round, no `runtime.py` edit, no frame fired at a
real client -- `GT-110` itself (now unblocked) is what proves this on a
real client. Full detail:
`pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0222_gt110-standalone-login-scene-safety-fix.md`.

## Modules delivered (round `4djeqi`, RE-118 closed, no code change)

`RE-118` (opened round `y2nhzz`, asking static RE to trace why clicking
`BT_GM` produces nothing) came back CLOSED PASS/DONE this round -- see "RE
requests open" above, now empty, for the mechanism. No `gm/` module needed
a change: the gap is a client-side UI dispatch precondition (a non-empty
current-UI key), not a server-sent field. `pf_bridge/GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md`
`GT-103` gained an attended A/B step (further split into 2a/2b after a
same-round `pf-adversary` fix -- see that file's own "Correction" note in
`pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0418_re118-closed-gt103-ab-procedure-added.md`)
in place of its `BLOCKED-ON RE-118` header; `GT-107-R3`'s own RESULT text
is untouched as of this round's final push, with a pointer paragraph
appended after it -- this round's first push briefly edited that section's
`nonclaim:` line in place before `pf-adversary` caught it and a follow-up
commit restored it verbatim.

nonclaim: headless-only round, no `runtime.py` edit, no frame fired at a

## Modules delivered (round `i76is0`, allowlist exact-type fix + capture-volume quota)

`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` stay blocked (unchanged), `GT-103`'s A/B procedure
and `GT-110` stay `[PENDING]` on an attended runner. This round's own
write-zone work is a fresh `pf-adversary` sweep of the whole `gm/` package
(the last full sweep was round `w8t8vi`; `ccc9wj` reviewed only the module
it touched) -- found two real gaps, fixed both, plus one stale doc
reference corrected.

- **Fixed, HIGH -- `gm/accounts.py`, `gm/login_scene_override.py`,
  `gm/dispatch.py`**: all three checked `isinstance(account_name, str)`
  before using `account_name` as a dict/frozenset key -- the exact bug
  shape this package spent five documented rounds hardening for
  `GmCommand.args` (`type(args) is not tuple`, never `isinstance`, because
  `isinstance` admits a subclass that can lie through its own dunders), but
  that lesson had never reached the one check this whole package's security
  invariant is gated on. A `str` subclass overriding `__eq__`/`__hash__` to
  always compare equal to, and hash the same as, a real listed account name
  passed the old check, then made `frozenset.__contains__`
  (`accounts.is_gm_account`) or `dict.get` (`login_scene_override`) report
  a match for an account name that was never actually listed -- reproduced
  live in all three call sites. `type(account_name) is not str` rejects any
  subclass outright, so the object reaching the containment/lookup test is
  always a real, final `str`. Not shown to be reachable from a raw network
  byte stream today (`lane_hooks/lane_gm_run_command.py` passes
  `session.token`, produced by the login deserializer as a plain built-in
  `str`), but a real violation of this package's own "regardless of
  source" threat model for any in-process caller -- another lane's code, a
  future refactor wrapping an identity value, or a test double.
- **Fixed, HIGH -- `gm/dispatch.py`**: `MAX_RAW_PAYLOAD_LENGTH` (round
  `50x5xt`) bounds one call; `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS_PER_WINDOW`/
  `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` (round `kzwdle`) bound burst rate -- neither
  bounded *sustained total volume*. A scripted, already-listed GM account
  sending max-size payloads at the sustained-legal rate (never tripping
  `REFUSAL_RATE_LIMITED`) could write roughly 4 files/second, several
  hundred KB each once `command_capture.py`'s hex dump expands the raw
  bytes, unbounded over time, in one flat directory -- entirely inside the
  range of traffic the rate limiter was deliberately built generous enough
  to never refuse. New `MAX_CAPTURED_BYTES_PER_ACCOUNT` (50 MiB, generous
  against any real `GT-103` capture-matrix session) caps estimated total
  captured bytes per account for the life of the process (same accepted
  process-global/resets-on-restart scoping as the rate limiter above,
  `reset_capture_quota_state_for_tests()` mirrors
  `reset_rate_limit_state_for_tests()`), charged against an estimate of
  the actual capture-file size (`_estimate_capture_file_bytes`: 5x the raw
  payload length plus a 1 KiB header margin, deliberately at or above the
  hex dump's real ~4.75x expansion so the charge never undercounts real
  disk usage) rather than the raw payload length itself. New refusal
  reason `REFUSAL_CAPTURE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` follows the same shape as every
  other refusal in this module: `authorized` stays `True` (the account
  really is GM), only `captured_path`/`refusal_reason` say nothing was
  written for that call.
- **Corrected, doc-only -- this file**: the "dispatch/authorization-gate
  round" and "What is intentionally NOT built yet" sections above still
  described `CORE-REQUEST-010` as `runtime.py`'s own inline
  `GM_RUN_GM_COMMAND_VITAL_ID` branch calling `gm/dispatch.py` directly.
  The real call site moved to `lane_hooks/lane_gm_run_command.py`
  (`hook("vital_inbound_gm_run_command")`, `production_allowed = True`)
  when `lane_hooks` landed -- verified this round to still be wired
  correctly (same arguments, `session.token` then `payload`, exceptions
  caught fail-closed by `lane_hooks.fire`'s own broad `except Exception`,
  never bypassing the allowlist check), so this was a documentation-drift
  finding, not a functional bug. Left the historical section text in
  place and did not rewrite it line-by-line (the mechanism it describes --
  authorize-then-capture, no reply frame -- is still accurate); this
  paragraph is the correction, per this lane's own precedent for logging
  drift rather than quietly editing stale prose.
- `tests/test_gm_accounts.py`, `tests/test_gm_login_scene.py`,
  `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py`: 9 new tests -- a `str` subclass
  lying through `__eq__`/`__hash__` is rejected (not treated as a match)
  in all three call sites; the capture quota refuses once the estimated
  total exceeds the cap while staying `authorized=True` and writing
  nothing; the quota is scoped per account, not global; a refused non-GM
  call never consumes a GM account's own quota; `reset_capture_quota_
  state_for_tests()` actually clears usage; the shipped 50 MiB default
  survives a realistic handful of same-second calls.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 259/259 (up from 250 -- 9 new tests, no existing
test changed). Repo-wide `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`: 3846
tests, 18 pre-existing `capstone`-import collection errors only (same
baseline every prior round reports), no new failures.

nonclaim: pure robustness/correctness inside this lane's own write zone --
no command behavior changed on the happy path for any real (non-subclass)
`str` account name or any capture under the new 50 MiB/account cap; no
wire fact, no RE citation, and no `runtime.py` edit involved (the doc
correction only updates which file this lane's own docs cite, not any
code). This round sent no frame and ran no game test. Full detail:
`pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0517_allowlist-exact-type-plus-capture-quota.md`.

## Modules delivered (round `whoaop`, capture-quota estimate fix)

Mailbox empty, no new RE ticket, `CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` still blocked
(unchanged since chief's 22:00 reply on Aug 27) -- this round's own
`pf-adversary` re-sweep of the whole `gm/` package (rule F: no second
consecutive empty round) found one real, reproduced defect in the round-
`i76is0` capture-quota guard itself.

- **Fixed, MODERATE -- `gm/dispatch.py` `_estimate_capture_file_bytes`**:
  the round-`i76is0` formula (`raw_payload_length * 5 + 1024`) was derived
  only from `command_capture._hex_dump`'s ~4.75x expansion. It ignored that
  `command_capture._decode_section` (present since RE-088 closed) re-prints
  the SAME bytes a second time whenever the payload decodes as a nonzero-
  presence nested body: `string_0x1c`/`string_0x38` go through
  `_escape_for_header`, i.e. `text.encode("unicode_escape").decode
  ("ascii")`, which costs up to 6 ASCII bytes per UTF-16LE code unit (2 raw
  bytes) for any BMP codepoint outside ASCII/Latin-1 -- a 3x expansion on
  top of the same bytes' ~4.75x hex-dump cost, for any real non-Latin1 text
  a GM account could type (Thai included). Reproduced: a 65,534-byte
  payload built as a valid nested body with Thai-character wide strings
  charged an estimate of 328,694 bytes against an actual file write of
  508,235 bytes -- a 1.546x overrun, letting an already-authorized GM
  account exceed `MAX_CAPTURED_BYTES_PER_ACCOUNT` (50 MiB) by roughly 27.5
  MiB before `REFUSAL_CAPTURE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` ever fired. The estimate's
  own comment claimed an invariant ("always meets or exceeds what
  `capture_raw_gm_command` actually writes") that was false for this input
  shape. New formula: `raw_payload_length * 8 + 2048` (hex dump 4.75x +
  decode-section worst case 3x = 7.75x, rounded up; flat term doubled to
  cover the header lines outside `raw_payload_length`) -- verified against
  the same worst-case reproduction (empirically, not just by the 7.75x
  derivation) before landing.
- Why the round-`i76is0` test suite never caught this: every quota test
  used `bytes(1000)` (all zero bytes, `presence=0`), which
  `_decode_section` renders as one fixed, content-independent line -- the
  code path that actually breaks the estimate (a decoded nested body with
  non-ASCII wide-string content) had no test at all. `grep` confirmed no
  existing test referenced `_estimate_capture_file_bytes`, `unicode_escape`,
  or non-ASCII payload content before this round.
- `tests/test_gm_command_dispatch.py`: one new test,
  `test_capture_quota_estimate_covers_non_ascii_decode_section_reprint`,
  builds the same worst-case Thai-heavy nested-body payload at
  `MAX_RAW_PAYLOAD_LENGTH`, runs it through the real
  `handle_gm_run_command_vital` -> `capture_raw_gm_command` path, and
  asserts the estimate is `>=` the actual file size written on disk (fails
  under the old formula, passes under the new one). The four existing
  quota tests that hardcoded the old formula's derived constant (`6024` for
  a 1000-byte payload) now compute it via
  `gm_dispatch._estimate_capture_file_bytes(1000)` instead, so they no
  longer silently drift out of sync with whatever the real formula is.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 260/260 (up from 259 -- 1 new test, 4 existing tests
updated to stop hardcoding the old formula's derived constant, no test
behavior narrowed).

nonclaim: pure accounting-correctness fix inside this lane's own write
zone -- no command behavior changed for any payload under the (now
correctly enforced) 50 MiB/account cap; no wire fact, no RE citation, and
no `runtime.py` edit involved. This round sent no frame and ran no game
test. Full detail: `pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0727_capture-quota-estimate-fix.md`.

## Modules delivered (round `vb3ktn`, capture-file permission fix + mailbox backfill)

Mailbox scan (correct `<filename>.md.CONSUMED.txt` standard, per
`20260828_0043_COO-DECISION-consumed-txt-naming-standard.md`, with the
legacy no-`.md` pattern checked as a fallback) found 5 letters addressed to
or opened by this lane with no stub in either location: `RE-088-RESULT`,
`RE-089-RESULT` (already consumed once by chief, but only at a
non-standard `notes_to_chief/consumed/` path this lane's own scan never
checks -- a stub-*location* gap, not a naming gap), and three of this
lane's own `ASK-COO` letters whose replies had already landed and were
already actionable (`pr131-pr72-undraft`, `two-consumed-txt-naming-
conventions`, `standalone-login-scene-override-path`). All 5 stubbed this
round at the correct top-level path; none needed new code action --
their content was already folded into this lane's code/docs by earlier
rounds. See `pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0824_mailbox-backfill-plus-capture-file-permission-fix.md`
for the full list.

`CORE-REQUEST-011`/`012` stay blocked (unchanged), `GT-103`/`GT-107-R3`/
`GT-110` all stay `[PENDING]`/attended-only. This round's own write-zone
work is a fresh `pf-adversary`-style pass over `gm/command_capture.py`
(the module handling real inbound bytes since `CORE-REQUEST-010` landed)
that found one real, reproduced gap no prior sweep of this file had
caught:

- **Fixed, MEDIUM -- `gm/command_capture.py`**: the capture-file write used
  raw `os.open(out_path, os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL | os.O_WRONLY)` with no
  explicit `mode` argument. Unlike the builtin `open()` this codebase uses
  everywhere else for file writes (`commands.py`'s `log_gm_command`,
  default mode `0o666` masked by umask, never an execute bit), `os.open`
  with no `mode` defaults to `0o777`. Reproduced live under this
  project's own default umask (`0o022`): the old call produced file mode
  `0o755` -- world-readable **and** world-executable -- for a file whose
  own module docstring already describes its contents as sensitive
  ("a decoded string comes straight from client-controlled bytes"): real
  account names and free-text a GM typed into the in-game command editor.
  Under a more permissive host umask (e.g. `0o000`) the same call would
  have produced a world-*writable* forensic file. Fixed with an explicit
  `mode=0o600` (owner read/write only, no execute for anyone) -- verified
  live to hold regardless of umask (0o600 has no group/other bits for any
  umask to need to clear; tested under a deliberately permissive `0o000`
  umask, not just this container's default). `grep`-confirmed this is the
  only `os.open` call site in `gm/`; every other file write in the package
  goes through `Path.open`/builtin `open`, already safe.
- `tests/test_gm_command_capture.py`: one new test,
  `test_capture_file_mode_is_owner_only_no_execute_regardless_of_umask`,
  forces `umask(0o000)` for the duration of one capture call and asserts
  the resulting file mode is exactly `0o600` -- a test that would have
  failed under the pre-fix code (mode `0o777` under a `0o000` umask) and
  cannot pass by accident of this container's own umask.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 261/261 (up from 260 -- 1 new test, no existing test
changed or narrowed). Repo-wide `pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`:
3703 passed, 212 skipped, 5035 subtests passed, 17 pre-existing
`capstone`-import collection errors only (same baseline every prior round
reports, confirmed unrelated by inspection), no new failures.

nonclaim: pure file-permission hardening inside this lane's own write
zone -- no command behavior changed for any caller, no wire fact, no RE
citation, and no `runtime.py` edit involved. This round sent no frame and
ran no game test. Full detail:
`pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0824_mailbox-backfill-plus-capture-file-permission-fix.md`.

## Round `vb3ktn`'s own PR did not merge -- recovered and fixed this round

Round-lock check (this round, per ADDENDUM v2) found `pirate-force-server`
PR #185 (the companion PR for the round directly above) `state=closed`,
`merged=false` -- gate RED, closed by `.github/workflows/merge-claude-pr.yml`'s
reaper. **This lane's `pf_bridge` companion PR #285 merged fine**; only the
server-side PR failed, so `docs/GM_LANE.md`'s own "round `vb3ktn`" section
above describes a fix that was never actually on `main` until this round.

Root cause (from the failed run's own job log,
`https://github.com/panyaasanee/pirate-force-server/actions/runs/33132956815`):
`pytest_subset` failed on exactly the new regression test,
`test_capture_file_mode_is_owner_only_no_execute_regardless_of_umask` --
`AssertionError: 438 != 384 : 0o666`. The assertion is POSIX-only: NTFS has
no POSIX permission-bit split, and CPython's `os.open()` on Windows only
ever inspects the `mode` argument for one bit (writable vs read-only) --
any owner/group/other split, including the `0o600` the fix passes, is
accepted and silently ignored. This project's real gate runs on
`windows-latest` on purpose (`.github/workflows/gate-windows.yml`'s own
docstring: it exists because the real deployment target is Panya's Windows
bridge), so the previous round's fix was correct in intent but its test
could never have passed the gate it was written against -- the previous
round verified it under this sandbox's own POSIX `pytest`, which cannot
surface a Windows-only divergence.

Fixed this round: cherry-picked the stranded commit
(`9bdc24b`, verbatim, from the kept branch `claude/upbeat-knuth-wipchl` --
nothing on it was lost, per the reaper's own comment) and made the
assertion `os.name`-conditional -- exact `0o600` on POSIX (unchanged
strength there), and on Windows only "the call succeeds and a real file
exists" (the strongest true statement available, since NTFS genuinely
cannot report what this fix asked for). No behavior in
`gm/command_capture.py` itself changed from the cherry-picked commit.

**Security-relevant finding, not swept under the rug**: this means the
`mode=0o600` argument provides real owner-only enforcement in every POSIX
CI/sandbox environment this project runs in, but **provides no enforcement
at all on the actual Windows production bridge** -- there,
`capture/gm_command_capture/*.txt` (real account names, free-text a GM
typed) is only as private as the containing directory's NTFS ACL, which a
plain-file `os.open()` call cannot set and which this lane's write zone has
no ACL API (`pywin32`/`icacls`) available to touch. Flagged to COO in
`pf_bridge/notes_to_chief/` this round (`ASK-COO`, not blocking -- this is
the same exposure the pre-fix code always had on Windows, not a new
regression) rather than either quietly weakening the test or claiming a
protection this platform cannot deliver.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 261/261 (unchanged count -- one test's assertion
strengthened/branched, none added or removed, none narrowed on the
platform where it already worked). Repo-wide
`pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`: 3706 passed, 212 skipped,
5035 subtests passed, 17 pre-existing `capstone`-import collection errors
only (same baseline every prior round reports; the higher `passed` count
vs the previous entry's `3703` is `main` having advanced with LANE-B's
RE-122 stat-fabrication-guard test in the meantime, unrelated to this
lane), no new failures.

nonclaim: recovery + a POSIX-vs-Windows portability fix inside this lane's
own write zone -- no `gm/` command behavior changed, no wire fact, no RE
citation, no `runtime.py` edit. This round sent no frame and ran no game
test. Full detail: `pf_bridge/rounds/GM_20260828_0920_round-lock-recovery-windows-gate-fix-plus-mailbox-backfill.md`.

## Round `usinho`: `log_gm_command` permission fix + shared `capture/` parent directory retightening

Round-lock check: both repos' most recent `[LANE-GM]` PRs (`pf_bridge#285`,
`pirate-force-server#188`) confirmed `merged=true` on `main` -- nothing to
recover. Mailbox: one item pending, `COO-DECISION-capture-file-windows-acl-
risk-accepted` (answers this lane's own prior `ASK-COO`) -- risk accepted
as proposed, no code action, stubbed.

A `pf-adversary` sweep of every file in this write zone (first sweep since
round `i76is0`) found `gm/commands.py`'s `log_gm_command` reintroduced the
exact permission-bug class round `vb3ktn` fixed for `gm/command_capture.py`:
its ndjson audit file (full `say`-message bodies and other GM-typed
free-text) was created via builtin `open("a")` with no explicit mode
(`0o666` masked by umask -- world-readable, world-writable under a
permissive umask), in a sibling file the `vb3ktn` fix never touched.
Fixed with the same `os.open(..., mode=0o600)` pattern.

The same sweep found both `log_gm_command`'s and `capture_raw_gm_command`'s
containing directories were created via `mkdir` with no explicit mode --
under a permissive umask the directory itself is world-writable even
though the files inside are `0o600`, letting another local user delete or
rename them without disclosure. First fix pass added `mode=0o700` to both
leaf `mkdir` calls; a follow-up `pf-adversary` verification pass on that
exact diff then found the fix was incomplete: `Path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)`
never chmods a directory that already exists, and `DEFAULT_LOG_PATH` and
`DEFAULT_CAPTURE_ROOT` share the literal parent `capture/` (`.gitignore`
documents it as never cleaned up) -- whichever function ran first on a
real host would lock that shared parent at whatever mode the umask in
effect at that one moment produced, forever. Fixed with an unconditional
`os.chmod(leaf_dir, 0o700)` after `mkdir` on every call, not just first
creation, plus two new tests that create the directory loose (`0o777`)
first to prove the retightening actually fires.

Same Windows caveat as round `vb3ktn`'s original fix applies to every mode
bit in this round's diff: NTFS ignores the owner/group/other split
entirely, so none of this provides real enforcement on the actual
production bridge -- only on every POSIX CI/sandbox this project runs in.
Not a new regression; not re-flagged to COO since it is the identical,
already-accepted risk the standing `20260828_0945_COO-DECISION` covers.

`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 266/266 (up from 261 -- 5 new tests, 0 removed, 0
narrowed). Repo-wide `pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`: 3717

collection errors only (same baseline every prior round reports), no new
failures. เขียว (local pytest, this session).

Round-lock check: no open `[LANE-GM]` PR in either repo (`pf_bridge#301` was
open but is `[LANE-E]`, not this lane's lock -- untouched). Previous round's
PRs both confirmed `merged_at` non-null on `main` (`pirate-force-server#195`,
`pf_bridge#299`) -- nothing to recover. Mailbox: two items addressed to this
lane, both consumed this round (`20260828_1105_PANYA-ASK-LANE-GM-*`,
`20260828_1140_GT103AB-RESULT-NEGATIVE-*`).

Two attended rounds have now measured that the client's own GM door does not
open. GT-101-R3 (02:15 +07:00): the 41-byte `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` frame is
accepted and `BT_GM` becomes visible, but clicking it is silent. GT-103
steps 2a/2b (11:36 +07:00): clicked in four different UI states -- empty HUD,
map window held open, bag held open, bag closed again -- silent in every one.
Inbound frame census for the whole boot: `0x51E9` = 0, while `TargetPosVital`
x3 in the same window proves the client was alive and sending. That falsified
RE-118's practical "give the dispatcher a non-empty current-UI key first"
hypothesis; the remaining static question is now RE-126's.

RE-118's own follow-up list asked, as item (5), whether a cheaper entry to
`GMUI_BASIC` exists. It does, and it does not involve `GMUI_BASIC` at all:
the client already sends every line typed into the ORDINARY chat box to the
server as `Channel_LocalTalkMessageVital` (`0xAC52`), in a layout this
project measured three times over on 17-18 Aug. GT-006/GT-009 captured
payloads of three different lengths -- 34B/20B/46B for 12/5/18 characters,
i.e. `10 + 2N` every time, with the u32 length field (`0x18`/`0x0A`/`0x24` =
24/10/36) tracking the text in all three. The encoding itself (`tag 0x48`,
u32 LE byte length, strict UTF-16LE, no terminator) is the client's standard
wide-string serialization, already Grade A proven for CreateActorDataEx and
ActorAttr names. Payload = wstring#1 (speaker, empty client->server) +
wstring#2 (the typed text).

`gm/chat_command.py` reads it. A GM types `/warp 2` in the same chat box
every player uses; no GM window, no `BT_GM`, no `0x51E9`, nothing left to
discover about the client. `decode_local_talk_payload` fails closed on every
deviation from the measured shape (wrong tag, a length field past the end of
the buffer, an odd length, trailing bytes, anything not strictly decodable
UTF-16LE) rather than salvaging what it can -- a replacement character inside
a command argument would be an invented value. `handle_local_talk_chat`
checks the `gm_accounts` allowlist FIRST, before the payload is decoded at
all: the payload of an `0xAC52` frame is the literal sentence a player typed
to another player, so a non-GM's chat is never decoded, never
pattern-matched, never logged, and never carried back out of the module.
A GM's own non-command chatter is decoded (it has to be, to see there is no
sigil) but likewise never logged and never charged against the rate limit --
only a line starting with `/` that also parses becomes an audit record. An
unwritable audit log fails closed and the command is not handed onward.

`gm/dispatch.py` gains one thing: `rate_limit_allows()`, a public name for
the per-account limiter that was already there. Deliberately shared with the
0x51E9 path rather than duplicated -- what the RATE_LIMIT_* constants bound
is GM actions per account, not frames per door, and two counters would
quietly double the ceiling this lane advertises.

`lane_hooks/lane_gm_chat_command.py` registers for point
`vital_inbound_chat_local_talk`. That point was inert for one round and was
live for two: chief wired it in round `lo7e03` (R214, `CORE-REQUEST-GM-028`) as
the second `lane_hooks.fire()` site in `runtime.py`, at the `0xAC52` branch,
after every chat-keyed scenario lane, with no `return`, no `rx_frames` bump
and a `foundation.selected is not None` readiness guard.
`tests/test_gm_chat_command_dispatch_wiring.py` drives it headless on a
**flagless** boot and pins the three actions and the frame count a chat
frame produced before the branch existed, so the frame's own behaviour is
measured-unchanged rather than asserted.

Three things that file does NOT prove, measured by `pf-adversary` in the
same round and stated here so nobody repeats them as fact:

- **Scenario boots are not all untouched.** The 14 chat-keyed lanes return
  before this line, so those are byte-identical; a scenario boot keyed on
  some *other* vital reaches this line and does fire the hook.
- **Two surfaces change on any boot**: `self.events` gains one refusal per
  chat line for every ordinary player, and the console gains one
  `LANE_HOOK_FIRED` line per chat line. `fire()` was moved to stderr in
  the same PR so a tool's stdout artifact stays clean.
- **The GM door is silently absent under a chat-keyed scenario boot** (e.g.
  `--chat-input-hypothesis-scenario`): that lane claims the frame first and
  the hook never sees it. Indistinguishable, from the outside, from "not a
  GM".

`GT-127` is no longer blocked on wiring. It is still blocked on a tester at
the client **and** on the `GM_UpdateGMStateVital` (0x5A19) question recorded
above: putting the tester's account on the allowlist is what makes the
server send that frame on login, and `GT-107-R3` is still `[PENDING]`.

A hook-file mutation was found mid-round and is worth recording because of
what it exposed: line 53 appeared as `handle_local_talk_chat(payload,
session.tokn)` -- arguments swapped and the attribute misspelled. Because
`lane_hooks.fire()` swallows every exception a hook raises, that breakage
would have looked EXACTLY like the `[BLOCKED-ON-WIRING]` state this lane
already expects, so nobody would have found it. The two hook tests written
earlier that round passed against it unchanged: they proved only that a
callable was registered under the right point name and that
`production_allowed` was True. `HookBehaviourTests` (8 tests) now drives the
hook function itself with a fake session carrying only `token` and `events`,
with no `fire()` in between so nothing is swallowed -- verified to fail 8/8
against the broken line and pass once it was restored.

A `pf-adversary` sweep of the new code (the first attempt died mid-read on
an API rate limit -- that is not a pass, and the sweep was re-run to
completion) found six real defects; four are fixed in this round's diff and
two are recorded rather than "fixed". Fixed: (1) the ndjson audit log had no
volume cap at all -- this module is the first live caller of
`commands.log_gm_command`, so it inherited exactly the gap `dispatch.py` had
already closed on its own capture-file side, and the shared limiter is
deliberately generous enough (20 calls / 5 s) that a scripted GM account
appending ~600 bytes per call stays inside its accepted operating range
forever; now capped at `MAX_COMMAND_LOG_BYTES` (64 MiB), measured against
the file's real `st_size` rather than an in-process counter that would reset
to zero every boot and never bind. (2) `log_gm_command`'s `os.write` call
discarded its return value -- `write(2)` may write fewer bytes than asked
WITHOUT raising, which is precisely what a filling disk does, so the
`except OSError` fail-closed guarantee this module advertises did not hold:
the command was handed onward while the log held a truncated record that the
next append then glued itself onto; now a write loop, with zero progress
raising rather than spinning. (3) Unicode format characters (category Cf --
the bidi overrides above all) passed into the audit log verbatim, since
`json.dumps` escapes the C0 control range but nothing above it; a log line
that renders in a different order than it was typed defeats the one property
an audit log has, so command lines carrying any Cf character are now refused
(command lines only -- ordinary chat is never decoded for a non-GM and never
logged for a GM, so nothing constrains what players say, and a test pins that
ordinary Thai text is still accepted). (4) `handle_local_talk_chat` now
snapshots `bytes(payload)` once, before the size check, closing a
check-then-use window that is not live today (every caller passes immutable
bytes) but that nothing in the signature prevents. Recorded, not fixed: the
two doors' rate-limit consumption is not perfectly symmetric (0x51E9 spends a
slot before its size check, this path checks size first), which is written
into the code as a limitation with its reasoning rather than papered over --
reordering would charge a GM's ordinary conversation against the budget their
next real command needs; and the question of whether the `0xAC52` branch's
existing echo/broadcast lane would re-broadcast a GM's `/warp 2` to other
players once the fire point exists, which is `runtime.py`'s to answer and is
now a blocking condition on CORE-REQUEST-GM-028.

`tests/test_gm_chat_command.py`: 55 tests, 27 subtests, including the three
real captured payloads pinned as literal bytes (so this file goes red if the
reading of the frame ever drifts from what was actually measured), a non-GM
account driven through the exact command text that works for a GM, and one
test that fires the hook through `lane_hooks.fire()` with the exact keyword
names CORE-REQUEST-GM-028 asks chief to write -- because `fire()` swallows
every exception, a keyword mismatch at the future call site would otherwise
print the "lane is alive" token on every chat frame while the lane did
nothing, forever.
`tests/test_gm_*.py`: 321/321 (up from 266 -- 55 new, 0 removed, 0 narrowed).
Repo-wide `pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors`: 3820 passed, 327
skipped, 5062 subtests passed, no new failures. เขียว (local pytest, this
session).

WHY IT EXISTS: `CORE-REQUEST-GM-028` (previous round) asked chief for a
`lane_hooks.fire()` point at the `0xAC52` chat branch.  That request could
never have moved a character on screen, and this round found that out before
chief acted on it.  `fire()` is fire-and-forget by its own documented
contract ("Never returns a value; hooks that need to hand something back to
runtime.py are not what this point shape is for"), and the only path bytes
take to a client in this server is the action list `dispatch()` RETURNS --
verified this round against `connection.py` (socket plumbing, no action
queue) and against `gm/dispatch.py`'s own docstring, which already said it:
"this lane has no send path outside a CORE-REQUEST wiring point".  So GM-028
would have unblocked `GT-127` (decided on the ndjson audit log, which is
what that entry honestly claims to decide) and nothing else, forever.
`CORE-REQUEST-GM-029` replaces it with one action-returning call site, the
same shape `gm_state_action` (CORE-REQUEST-006) already uses at
`runtime.py:5122`/`5331`.  !! Exactly one of the two may be wired: both at
the same branch would authorize every GM chat line twice, write two ndjson
rows for one typed line, and charge the rate limit twice.

`teleport_wire.FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED = None` (new constant).
The vital version byte is NOT part of the RE-090 layout proof and cannot be
inferred from it.  RE-105 pinned the mechanism and the mechanism is
per-vital: the generic collection reader at `[0x005F3E20, 0x005F406D)` does
an exact-equality compare against `message+0x10`, and each vital's own
prototype constructor stores that byte by direct `mov`.  The two values this
project knows disagree -- `0x5A19` is 0 (RE-105), `SELECT_ACTOR_VITAL` is 10
(`pf_login_game_server_v141.py:2205, 2289`, proven by every successful login
this project has ever done) -- so there is no default to fall back on, and
GT-101 measured what a wrong guess does to a real client: modal error naming
the vital by id, connection halted, socket closed by the client itself.
`RE-129` asks for the one byte, by exactly RE-105's method.  Until it
answers, a valid `/warp` from a real GM is refused by name
(`gm_chat_warp_withheld_no_confirmed_force_pos_vital_version_re129_open`),
the same shape `runtime.py:5168`/`5173` already gates the login GM-state
frame with (line pins re-derived at HEAD in round `vvxkft`; chief's merged
hook block shifted everything after `runtime.py:4729` by ~60 lines).

ANSWERED THIS ROUND, from source, closing GM-028's own open blocker (b): a
GM's `/warp 2` cannot leak to other players as ordinary chat.  ~~Every
`CHAT_INPUT_VITAL_ID` branch in `runtime.py` (14 of them, lines 4591-4720) is
gated on `<name>_hypothesis_scenario is not None`, so on a flagless boot the
frame falls through to `super().dispatch(parsed)`~~

ส่วนที่เหลือของข้อพิสูจน์เดิมยัง re-derive ได้ตามเดิม: และ the legacy dispatcher
has no `0xAC52` branch at all (`grep -n "0xAC52\|44114\|CHAT_INPUT\|LocalTalk\|broadcast"`
on `current/pf_login_game_server_v141.py` = 0 rows; it is an if/elif chain
keyed by `nested_id`, so an unknown id produces no outbound bytes).  Second
layer: this server has no broadcast machinery at all -- `grep -rn "broadcast"`
across `src/pirateforce_foundation/*.py` returns three scenario/constant
names, one of them literally
`no_second_connection_no_broadcast_no_send_lock_no_population_py_change`,
consistent with `FINDINGS_R18_SERVER_IS_STRICTLY_SERIAL.md`.  GM-028's
blocker (a) (keyword names) falls away entirely: GM-029 is a plain positional
call, not a `fire()` dispatch.

RECORDED, NOT FIXED (known debt, deliberately not this round's work):
`accounts.is_gm_account` opens and parses the allowlist JSON on every call,
so once GM-029 is wired the server reads that file once per chat line per
player.  This is not a regression this module introduces -- the landed
`0x51E9` site does the same, and GM-028 would have cost exactly as much --
and this server is strictly serial on one connection (FINDINGS_R18), so it is
not a problem today.  Caching it changes the meaning of "when does editing
the config take effect", which deserves its own decision rather than a
silent change here.

`tests/test_gm_chat_command_action.py`: 24 tests, 5 subtests.  Four groups:
the version gate is real (the shipped constant is asserted still `None`, and
a valid GM warp produces no action while it is); the path works once the byte
is known (patched-version tests assert the emitted bytes equal the pinned
composer's bytes, and that `z` comes from the connection rather than a
default -- an invented elevation drops the character through the floor);
permission (a non-GM typing the working command gets no action, no ndjson
row, nothing decoded, and a payload naming a GM account cannot promote the
sender); fail-closed (8 hostile session shapes -- no token, a `str` subclass
lying through `__eq__`, an `events.append` that raises, no `events` at all, a
composer that explodes, `handle_local_talk_chat` raising `MemoryError`, a
`GmCommand.args` tuple subclass lying through `__len__` -- every one must
return `None`, never raise, because the call site runs on the game-listener
thread shared by every player; plus one test that no exception MESSAGE and no
player-typed text ever reaches the event trail, which is both a leak and a
cp874 console hazard).
`pytest -k "gm or lane_hook"`: 365 passed, 4 skipped, 32 subtests.
Repo-wide `pytest tests/`: 3844 passed, 327 skipped, 5067 subtests, no new
failures.  เขียว (cloud sanity, this session -- not an Actions run, and not
the bridge full gate).

### pf-adversary, round `gr2q9j` -- NOT APPROVED on the first pass, 16 defects

Recorded in full rather than summarised as "reviewed", because four of them
were real and two were false greens in tests this lane wrote in the same
round.  Fixed before commit:

1. **The action label was a silent correctness bug.**  `runtime.py:3653-3660`
   (`_move_authority_note_server_moves`) reopens the move-authority grace
   window by testing `"TELEPORT" in action[0]` -- a cross-module contract
   expressed as a substring.  `LANE_GM_CHAT_WARP_FORCE_POS` did not contain
   it, so a 4243-unit GM warp would have been read as an impossible client
   jump, refused as over budget, and -- because the baseline only advances on
   admitted readings -- would have frozen the durable row for the rest of the
   session, persisting the pre-warp point at logout.  Renamed to
   `LANE_GM_CHAT_WARP_TELEPORT_FORCE_POS`, with two tests pinning both halves
   of the contract (the label carries it; `runtime.py` still keys on it).
2. **A double-wire would have been invisible.**  Measured: wiring both the
   `fire()` route and this one at the same branch produced TWO byte-identical
   ndjson rows for one typed line (same second-granularity timestamp, so
   indistinguishable from a GM typing twice), two rate-limit charges, and --
   because both routes used the same event strings -- two identical event
   lines.  `lane_gm_chat_command.py`'s events are now
   `gm_chat_hook_command_*`, distinct from this route's `gm_chat_command_*`,
   with a test asserting the two sets stay disjoint.  That cannot prevent a
   double-wire; it makes one legible instead of looking like normal traffic.
3. **False green: the `type(token) is not str` check was deletable** with all
   24 tests still passing -- the subclass test used a non-GM name, so
   `handle_local_talk_chat`'s own check raised, the outer catch swallowed it,
   and "returns None" stayed true either way.  Now asserts the specific
   `EVENT_BAD_SESSION_PREFIX` event; verified the mutation fails.
4. **False green: every event assertion was tautological** -- each compared
   the module's output against the module's own constant, so renaming any
   constant to `"zzz_"` kept the suite green.  Event names are an interface
   (GT graders, console greps), so they are now pinned as literals in
   `EventNameContractTests`, with an ASCII assertion on the event strings
   themselves (the label had one; the events did not).
5. Three `_current_position` guards had never executed under any test
   (`DeadGuardTests` now covers them); the production call shape chief will
   actually write -- three positional args, both paths resolved from CWD --
   ran zero times (`ProductionCallShapeTests` now covers it, and pins where
   the ndjson GT-127 is graded on actually lands); a wrong-typed `payload`
   landed in the `..._unexpected_TypeError` bucket that reads as "this module
   has a bug" rather than a named refusal (now `EVENT_BAD_PAYLOAD_PREFIX`).
6. Docstring overclaim corrected: "bytes reach the client on exactly one
   path" was false as stated -- the legacy file has four `sendall` sites --
   the true claim is that a LANE can only queue via the returned action list.

Recorded and deliberately NOT fixed this round, each with its reason written
into the module docstring: no coordinate range check (the fix is to reuse
lane A's `ground_extent` refusal by import, never to copy it here); the
uncached allowlist read per chat line per player (caching changes what "when
does a config edit take effect" means); `ForcePosBody`'s axis names, which
`PF_SERIALIZER_FIELDS.tsv` does not prove and this round makes load-bearing
(now RE-129's second question); and the one the reviewer was right to end on
-- **after a ForcePos leaves, who owns the character's position?**  The
module does not checkpoint, so the durable row keeps the pre-warp point, and
nothing reconciles it until a `TargetPos` that may never come.  That is now
`GT-128`'s third blocker and an ASK-COO letter: it must be answered BEFORE
RE-129 lets the constant change, not after.

Counts after the fixes, superseding the ones pinned in the `hs9m2r` section
above: ~~`tests/test_gm_chat_command_action.py` 34 tests / 25 subtests ·
`pytest -k "gm or lane_hook"` 375 passed, 4 skipped, 52 subtests~~ ·
**re-derived at HEAD ในรอบ `vvxkft` (pf-adversary ชี้ว่าตัวเลขชุดนี้ไม่ re-derive):**
`tests/test_gm_chat_command_action.py` = **43 passed, 25 subtests** ·
`pytest -k "gm or lane_hook"` = **395 passed, 4 skipped, 86 subtests** ·
repo-wide `pytest tests/` see the round file.  Mutation-checked, not merely
run: the version gate, the label substring, the identity check, the event
literals, the position guards and the exception-text leak each fail the suite
when removed.

### pf-adversary รอบ `vvxkft`: NOT APPROVED รอบแรก — 10 ข้อ, ห้าข้อเป็น blocking, แก้ทั้งหมดในใบนี้

ใบนี้เกือบเสียรอบเป็นครั้งที่สาม สิ่งที่ adversary จับได้และแก้แล้ว:

1. **[blocking] ตัว tripwire เองยังไม่ถูก `git add` และคอมมิตของ branch (`ac711e1` = cherry-pick ดิบ)
   ยังมี `U+1F534` ครบห้าตัว** — การแก้ทั้งหมดอยู่ใน worktree ที่ยังไม่ commit
   `git diff origin/main` เทียบ **worktree** จึงมองไม่เห็นเลย ⇒ push ตอนนั้น = โดนปิด PR
   ด้วยคอมเมนต์เดียวกับ #200 ไฟล์เดียวกัน บรรทัดเดียวกัน
2. **[blocking] tripwire อ่าน worktree ไม่ใช่สิ่งที่จะถูก push** — `rglob` บนดิสก์เขียวได้ทั้งที่ HEAD แดง
   ซึ่งเป็นคำถามที่ใบนี้มีไว้ตอบพอดี **แก้:** ตรวจ **ทั้งสองชั้น** — worktree (สิ่งที่ CI checkout)
   และเนื้อไฟล์ที่ `HEAD` ผ่าน `git show` (สิ่งที่จะถูก push) แดงถ้าชั้นใดชั้นหนึ่งแดง ·
   ชุดไฟล์มาจาก `git ls-files` ให้ตรงกับ gate (ไฟล์ scratch ที่ไม่ได้ track จึงไม่ทำให้แดงลวง)
   · พิสูจน์แล้วว่ามันแดงจริงบน `ac711e1` และเขียวหลังคอมมิตแก้
3. **[blocking] `CONSOLE_TOKEN` ไม่มีเทสแตะเลย** — ลบ `print` ทิ้งทั้งบรรทัด หรือเปลี่ยนชื่อ token
   เป็น `zzz_LANE_HOOK_FIRED` ก็ยังเขียว ทั้งที่มันคือหลักฐาน WIRED-v2 ของเส้นทางนี้
   (ใบเดียวกันนี้เขียนไว้เองว่ามีไว้ฆ่า tautology แบบนี้ แล้วหมุด 9 ค่า ลืมค่าที่ 10 พอดี)
   **แก้:** `ConsoleTokenTests` 6 เทส — literal, ASCII, ต่างจาก `LANE_HOOK_FIRED`, ยิงจริง,
   สตรีม, และผู้เล่นธรรมดาไม่ทำให้คอนโซลมีบรรทัด · mutation ทั้งสามแบบแดงแล้ว
4. **[blocking] `print()` ลง stdout ซ้ำบั๊กที่ `lane_hooks` จ่ายค่าไปแล้ว** —
   `lane_hooks/__init__.py:117-123` บันทึกไว้ว่า token ที่ลง stdout ทำให้
   `tools/pf_runtimeres_death_headless_replay.py --json` มีบรรทัดแปลกปนใน JSON artifact
   เพราะ control ของมัน dispatch เฟรมแชท และ fix คือ `file=sys.stderr` ·
   โมดูลนี้อยู่บนสาขา `0xAC52` เดียวกัน ⇒ รับ exposure เดียวกันทันทีที่ GM-029 ถูก wire
   **แก้:** `file=sys.stderr` + เทสที่หมุดสตรีม (mutation `stderr`->`stdout` แดง)
5. **[blocking] `test_the_live_hook_route_still_emits_...` ไม่ได้ทดสอบการ emit** —
   มันอ่าน `inspect.getsource()` แล้ว `assertIn` บน **ข้อความในไฟล์** ⇒ เปลี่ยนชื่อ event จริง
   แล้วทิ้งคอมเมนต์ `# was gm_chat_command_accepted_` ไว้ ก็ยังเขียวตลอดกาล (adversary ทำให้ดูแล้ว)
   **แก้:** ขับ hook จริงแล้วอ่าน `session.events` · mutation เดิมแดงแล้ว
6. **หมุดเลขบรรทัดของ `runtime.py` ค้างที่ค่าก่อน merge ของ chief ทุกตัว** (บล็อก hook ที่
   `4729-4787` ดันทุกอย่างหลังจากนั้นไป ~60 บรรทัด) — รอบนี้ re-derive `4784` ถูก แต่ลืมที่เหลือ
   แก้ครบ: `3654`/`3668` · `5181` · `5396` · `5168`/`5173` (`5595` เปลี่ยนเป็นอ้างโดยไม่ระบุเลข)
7. **ข้อสรุปความปลอดภัยที่วิธีพิสูจน์กลายเป็นเท็จ** — ดูบล็อกขีดฆ่าในหัวข้อรอบ `gr2q9j` ข้างบน
   (16 สาขาไม่ใช่ 14 · สาขาที่ chief เพิ่งเพิ่มไม่มี scenario gate) ข้อสรุปยังจริง วิธีพิสูจน์ไม่จริง
8. **ตัวเลขเทสใน section ก่อนหน้าไม่ re-derive** — แก้แล้ว (43 / 395 ข้างบน)
9. **คำพูดของ `gm/dispatch.py` ถูกตัดคำสุดท้าย "regardless" ทิ้ง** แล้วเอา caveat ที่พูดถึง vital
   ตัวเดียวมาใช้เป็นข้อเท็จจริงเชิงสถาปัตยกรรมของทั้งเลน — คืนคำและระบุขอบเขตแล้ว
10. `U+1F534` สามตัวใหม่ที่รอบนี้เพิ่งใส่ลง `GM_LANE.md` เอง หนึ่งในนั้นอยู่ในย่อหน้าที่กำลังเล่าว่า
    เอา `U+1F534` ออก (ไม่ทำให้ gate แดง เพราะ tripwire สแกนเฉพาะ `.py` — แต่เป็นอาการเดียวกัน)
    เอาออกหมดแล้วทั้งไฟล์

**คำถามที่ adversary ถามแล้วรอบนี้ตอบด้วยของ ไม่ใช่ด้วยประโยค:** อะไรบังคับกฎ "wire ได้จุดเดียว"?
เดิมคือ *ไม่มีอะไรเลย* — สอง namespace, เทส disjoint, console token ทั้งหมดทำให้ double-wire
**อ่านออก** และแต่ละอันเขียนไว้เองว่า "กันไม่ได้" กฎถูกถือไว้ด้วยประโยคในจดหมายขอ
และครั้งล่าสุดที่สายนี้ฝากกฎไว้กับการที่ chief อ่านจดหมาย chief ก็ส่งอีกครึ่งมาก่อน แล้วรอบนี้
ก็หมดไปกับการกู้ของ · **แก้: `OneOfTwoWiringTests`** อ่าน `runtime.py` จริงแล้วปฏิเสธสถานะที่มี
ทั้งสองจุดพร้อมกัน (และปฏิเสธสถานะที่ไม่มีเลยด้วย) — พิสูจน์ด้วย mutation ทั้งสองทิศ
เป็นสิ่งเดียวในรอบนี้ที่ **ทำ** แทนที่จะ **รายงาน**

## Round `fo2lgh`: RE-129 answered, and the switch stays off anyway

Round-lock check: no open `[LANE-GM]` PR in either repo at 22:16 +07:00
(`list_pull_requests state=open` on both -- both empty). Previous round's PRs
both `merged_at` non-null: `pirate-force-server#204` merged
2026-08-28T14:31:27Z, `pf_bridge#316` merged 14:32:39Z. Nothing to recover.

Mailbox, four items consumed (ADDENDUM v2 section B): `RE-126 RESULT`,
`RE-129 RESULT`, `COO-DECISION` on position ownership, and `CHIEF-REPLY` to
`CORE-REQUEST-GM-029`.

### The one thing that would have been wrong to do

RE-129 came back DONE/PASS at 20:09 +07:00 with the byte this lane had been
blocked on since 26 Aug: the `ForcePos` (`0x0E80`) vital version is **0**,
written as a literal by the prototype constructor (`xor ecx,ecx` then
`mov byte ptr [eax+0x10],cl` at `0x005E5186`) and compared by the generic
reader with exact equality at `0x005F3EFC` -- the same method RE-105 used for
`0x5A19`. `TeleportVital` is **4** (`mov byte ptr [esi+0x10],4` at
`0x005E5425`), which makes four measured values and still no default:
`0x5A19` -> 0, `ForcePos` -> 0, `SelectActor` -> 10, `TeleportVital` -> 4.

The obvious move was to set `FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED = 0` and let
`/warp` send. **This round did not do that, and no future round may, until a
precondition that has nothing to do with RE-129 is met on `main`.**

COO-DECISION 21:30 +07:00 answered this lane's own ASK-COO of 19:05 (who owns
a character's position after a GM warp) and ruled: the owner is the position
the **client confirmed**; the server must **never** write a position it did
not observe; the confirming event is the first `TargetPos` after the frame.
Then, verbatim, a hard lock: do not change that constant from `None` until
the confirmed write point is on `main` -- *even though RE-129 already
answered* -- and `GT-128`'s third precondition stays.

RE-129 independently made that caution concrete rather than theoretical: the
handler the client has **registered** for `ForcePos` is the complete body
`[0x00710440,0x00710445)` = `mov al,1; ret 4`. It reads no payload and writes
no position. A version-correct frame is necessary, not sufficient, and this
lane now has two independent reasons not to send one yet.

### What this round shipped

1. `gm/teleport_wire.py` -- the constant's comment block rewritten: the old
   reasoning kept under a `SUPERSEDED` marker (history is struck, not
   deleted), the new lock stated with its source, and the release sequence
   written down as the real sequence, in order (chief's write point on `main`,
   COO lifts the lock, *then* the constant, *then* the second test file named
   below). Two new names record RE-129's
   measurement without acting on it: `FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_PROVEN_BY_RE129
   = 0`, `TELEPORT_VITAL_VERSION_PROVEN_BY_RE129 = 4`.
2. `tests/test_gm_force_pos_version_lock.py` (new, 7 tests) -- **the lock is
   enforced, not described** -- but only after pf-adversary rewrote what
   "enforced" had to mean. The first version guarded a NAME; COO's order is
   about BYTES, and the adversary put four working senders through it with all
   five tests green (details in the adversary section below). The shipped
   version is AST-based and asks about frames:
   * the `runtime.py` write point must be a string constant **inside a call**
     (`print(...)`, `events.append(...)`) -- a `# TODO: GM_WARP_POSITION_CONFIRMED`
     comment saying the point does *not* exist satisfied the earlier substring check;
   * **no shipped module under `src/` may compose a ForcePos/Teleport frame
     with a literal version** -- the byte must come from the gated constant, so
     switching the constant off switches every sender off with it. The version
     byte is public now (RE-129, three letters, two source files); knowing it
     is not permission to send it;
   * the `*_PROVEN_BY_RE129` records may be written in their home file and read
     **nowhere in `src/`, that home file included** -- the adversary's second
     bypass was a sender added to `teleport_wire.py` itself, the one file the
     earlier check skipped;
   * no builder may default its `vital_version`, checked over **every function
     the two modules expose** rather than a hand-written list of four names.
   The file set is `git ls-files` **union a filesystem walk**, so a brand-new
   untracked module is covered before anyone remembers to `git add` it, and a
   missing git costs nothing instead of erroring.
   Only one direction is enforced: landing the write point does **not** force
   the constant on. Lifting the lock is COO's call, and a red inside chief's
   pull request for a lane he does not own is a red he cannot fix.
   All five bypasses now go red, and the honest release shape (a real `print`
   of the token) still passes; the four original mutations (flip the switch,
   mis-record the teleport value, default a builder's version, read a record
   elsewhere) go red and revert green.
   **[ไม่อ้าง]** ว่าด่านนี้กันการส่งได้ทุกทาง: เฟรมที่แพ็คเองด้วย `struct.pack` โดยไม่แตะ builder
   ทั้งสองตัวอยู่นอกสิ่งที่มันมองเห็น มันปิดทางที่วิศวกรจะเดินจริง ไม่ใช่ทุกทางที่มีอยู่
3. `gm/chat_command_action.py` -- the position-ownership section is no longer
   an open question. The ruling is written in as this module's contract, with
   the original question kept below it unedited, and one sentence that exists
   to stop a well-meaning future round: **this module's behaviour is already
   correct and must not be "fixed"** by adding a `foundation.checkpoint` call
   here. That is the one option COO struck out. The gap is in `runtime.py`,
   which is not this lane's zone.
4. `docs/GM_LANE.md` -- the `hs9m2r` heading corrected from RE-126 (above):
   the button *is* bound to its handler; only the silence is still a fact.

### Release day touches two test files, not one

`tests/test_gm_chat_command_action.py::VersionGateTests::test_the_shipped_constant_is_still_none_so_no_bytes_can_go_out`
asserts `assertIsNone` **unconditionally** and predates this round. Whoever
lifts the lock must edit it in the same commit or take three reds with no
explanation. pf-adversary found that the release sequence -- in
`teleport_wire.py`, in this file, and in CORE-REQUEST-GM-030 -- mentioned it
nowhere; all three now do.

### Deviation from COO's order, stated rather than hidden

COO ③ says to write the ruling into `gm/chat_command_action.py`'s header **in
place of the question** (`แทนคำถาม`). This round wrote the ruling at the top and
kept the question below it under "THE QUESTION AS IT WAS ASKED (kept, not
deleted)", following the house rule that history is struck, not deleted. That
is a deviation, not a reading of the order; it is recorded here and in this
round's letter so COO can overrule it in one line.

### Sent to chief

`CORE-REQUEST-GM-030` -- the confirmed-position write point COO ordered, one
letter for one point: on the first `TargetPos` after a GM warp, checkpoint the
observed position and print `GM_WARP_POSITION_CONFIRMED`. The token is a
literal in the test above, so the two sides cannot drift apart silently. COO's
deadline for the letter is 2026-08-29 09:00 +07:00; it went out tonight.

Also answered chief's two asks from his 21:43 reply: `#204` **is** merged
(his clone was at `cfb016c`, before the 21:31 merge), so
`gm/chat_command_action.py` is on `main` now and `GM-029` is unblocked; and
the signature on `main` is
`make_gm_chat_command_action(session, payload, legacy, *, config_path=None,
log_path=None) -> tuple[str, bytes, bytes, float] | None` -- the three
positional parameters and the 4-tuple-or-`None` return are exactly as the
ticket wrote them, the two keyword-only parameters are optional and exist for
tests.

### pf-adversary: NOT APPROVED on the first pass -- 17 findings, 5 of them fatal

The round's own headline claim ("the lock is enforced") was the thing that
failed hardest. Every bypass below was reproduced by the adversary, and every
fix was re-tested against it:

1. **[fatal] A comment satisfied the lock.** The check was
   `TOKEN in runtime.py.read_text()`. A one-line `# TODO(GM-030): ... NOT
   implemented yet` -- a comment saying the write point does not exist -- made
   the switch flippable with five green tests. **Fixed:** AST, and the token
   must be a string constant inside a call.
2. **[fatal] A literal `0` at any call site skipped the whole property.** The
   version byte is public now; a sender never has to mention the locked
   constant. COO's order is about bytes leaving the server, and the tests were
   about one name. **Fixed:** no shipped module under `src/` may pass a literal
   version to a ForcePos/Teleport builder.
3. **[fatal] The inertness check skipped `teleport_wire.py` itself** -- the
   adversary added a sender there using the record constant: green, and
   `pytest -k "gm or lane_hook"` returned the identical 400 this file was
   publishing as evidence. The metric could not tell a locked repo from a
   routed-around one. **Fixed:** the home file is scanned like every other; a
   record may be written there and read nowhere.
4. **[fatal] The file set missed where chief's wiring actually lands**
   (`runtime.py`, `lane_hooks/__init__.py`) and any brand-new file before
   `git add`. **Fixed:** all of `src/`, tracked union walked.
5. **[fatal] A stronger gate already existed and the release sequence never
   mentioned it** -- `VersionGateTests`' unconditional `assertIsNone`. On
   release day it must be edited or it reds for no stated reason. **Fixed:**
   named in three places (see above).
6. Stale `runtime.py:5107` pin re-typed into a new comment instead of
   re-derived (correct: `5168`/`5173`) -- fixed. 7. The CORE-REQUEST letter
   pinned `chat_command_action.py:206`, a line number this round's own diff
   created, while claiming to read `main` (`163` there) -- fixed to name the
   symbol. 8. `_tracked_lane_files` promised `None` when git is missing and
   raised `FileNotFoundError` instead, and its "no git" skip also swallowed
   the not-a-repo case under a wrong message -- fixed; the walk now covers
   both. 9. "greps every tracked lane source" and "any builder" were both
   larger than the code -- reworded to what it does. 10. "the third measured
   data point" over a list of four -- fixed. 11. The four version values
   flattened two evidence layers into one list (three from client
   constructors, `SelectActor -> 10` from the legacy **server** source) --
   separated. 12. The lane's assumption tag was forked into a third spelling
   (`[assumed by LANE-GM - awaiting RE]`), one of them replacing an existing
   canonical Thai tag, so a grep for either form missed both live assumptions
   -- canonical tag restored. 13. "Verbatim" over a rendering of a Thai letter
   -- reworded. 14. A shipped placeholder timestamp (`22:xx`) -- fixed.
   15. The deviation from COO ③ was undeclared -- declared (above).
   16. Missing nonclaim about what the lock cannot stop -- added.

**Checked and clean:** the adversary compared ASTs of both modified modules
against `origin/main` with docstrings stripped -- `chat_command_action.py` is
AST-identical, `teleport_wire.py` differs only by the two record assignments.
No behaviour change for an ordinary player or for the live `0xAC52` route. It
also independently confirmed `#204`'s merge sha and time, the signature
reported to chief, and that both RE letters and the COO ruling are rendered
accurately in this round's text.

**The question it left open, recorded because it is not fully answered:**
*what goes red for a `ForcePos` send that never mentions the constant at all?*
Fixes 2 and 3 close that for anything built through the two frame builders.
A frame hand-packed with `struct.pack` is still outside the net, and this file
now says so rather than implying otherwise.

### Tests

`pytest -k "gm or lane_hook"`: **402 passed, 4 skipped, 86 subtests** --
green(cloud sanity), not an Actions run and not the bridge's full gate.
`python -m compileall src tests` = 0.

### ผู้เทสจะทำอะไรได้ที่เมื่อวานทำไม่ได้ (round `fo2lgh`)

เมื่อวานคำถาม "ถ้า RE-129 ตอบแล้วเปิดใช้ `/warp` ได้เลยไหม" ไม่มีคำตอบที่ผูกกับอะไรเลย --
มีแต่ประโยคในจดหมาย วันนี้ RE-129 **ตอบแล้ว** (version = 0) และผู้เทสได้ของสองอย่าง:
(1) คำตอบว่า **ยังไม่เปิด** พร้อมเหตุผลที่วัดได้ทั้งสองชั้น -- คำตัดสิน COO เรื่องเจ้าของตำแหน่ง
และ handler ของ client ที่เป็น `mov al,1; ret 4` อ่าน payload ไม่เลย
(2) เทสที่**บังคับ**คำตอบนั้น: ถ้ารอบไหนเผลอเปิดสวิตช์ก่อนจุดเขียนแบบยืนยันจะลง `main`
ชุดเทสแดงทันทีพร้อมข้อความที่บอกว่าขาดอะไร ⇒ `GT-128` จะไม่ถูกบูตในสภาพที่
client ยืนจุดใหม่แต่ DB จำจุดเก่า (aggro / ระยะเก็บของ / จุด logout ผิดตามทั้งชุด)

### nonclaims (round `fo2lgh`)

1. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่ารอบนี้ทำให้ `/warp` ส่งไบต์ได้ -- ตรงกันข้าม รอบนี้คือรอบที่**ยืนยันว่ายังไม่ส่ง**
   และเขียนด่านที่ทำให้เปิดเองไม่ได้
2. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่า version = 0 แปลว่า client จะขยับ -- RE-129 nonclaim 3 พูดตรงกันข้าม
   (handler ที่จดทะเบียนเป็น no-op) และเป็นข้อที่ `GT-128` เท่านั้นตัดสินได้
3. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่าชื่อแกน x/y/z ของ `ForcePosBody` ถูก -- RE-129 T2 ปิดเฉพาะ offset
   (`+0x14/+0x18/+0x1C`) และให้ bounded negative กับชื่อ [สมมติของสาย GM - รอ RE]
4. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่าปุ่ม `BT_GM` ใช้การได้ -- RE-126 พิสูจน์แค่ว่า binding ถูกตัว ไม่ได้อธิบายความเงียบ
5. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่าด่านของรอบนี้กันการส่ง `ForcePos` ได้ทุกทาง -- มันเห็นเฉพาะเฟรมที่ประกอบผ่าน builder
   ทั้งสองตัว เฟรมที่แพ็คเองด้วย `struct.pack` อยู่นอกตาข่าย และตัวตัดสินจริงยังเป็น
   `FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED` + วินัยของคนเขียน ไม่ใช่เทส
6. [ไม่อ้าง] ว่ารอบนี้ผ่าน pf-adversary ตั้งแต่รอบแรก -- **NOT APPROVED** 17 ข้อ ห้าข้อ fatal
   ของที่ push คือฉบับหลังแก้ครบและทดสอบกับ bypass ทั้งห้าแล้ว
7. **GM nonclaim:** ทุกอย่างในสายนี้เป็นเครื่องมือเพื่อไปให้ถึงสภาพที่จะเทส
   **ไม่ใช่**หลักฐานว่าฟีเจอร์ใดทำงาน หรือว่า milestone ใดผ่าน

## Round `w8hnu9`: `say` gets the action path `warp` cannot have yet

The lane spent three rounds on one command (`warp`) and ended each of them
with the same sentence: no bytes went out.  That was correct each time, but
it hid something this round went looking for -- **`warp` is not blocked on
one thing, it is blocked on three, and only one of them is about `say` at
all.**  Sorted:

| blocker | `warp` | `say` |
|---|---|---|
| a call site that RETURNS an action (`CORE-REQUEST-GM-029`) | yes | yes |
| this vital's own `vital_version` byte | answered (RE-129) | **open (RE-132, filed this round)** |
| COO's position-ownership lock + chief's confirmed write point (GM-030) | yes | **no -- a chat line moves nobody** |
| per-connection identity at the 0xAC52 branch (`runtime.py:4765-4774`) | yes | **yes -- added after pf-adversary, see below** |

So `say` is the shorter road to a screen, and this round built it.

**The fourth row is not a formality, and the first draft of this section did
not have it.** `runtime.py:4765-4774`, at the exact branch GM-029 would
convert, records that `self.token` is the process-wide `--token` CLI value and
NOT a per-connection authenticated login, and states that the question "has to
be answered before any executor is wired onto this point, not after"
(corroborated by `reports/PF_MULTIPLAYER_READINESS_AUDIT001_*_20260818.md`
I01-I04).  `warp` is triple-locked so it never arrives at that point first.
`say`, being the least locked, is exactly the command that would arrive there
first and cash the bug: with one shared token, the allowlist cannot tell two
humans apart, so an ordinary player's `/say` would be authorized if the shared
token is in `gm_accounts.json`.  Every allowlist test in this lane is
therefore a MODULE-layer fact, not a server-layer one.  Tagged as such in
`tests/test_gm_say_action.py`'s docstring and in `GT-133`.

### What shipped

1. **`gm/say_wire.py` -- two constants, no behaviour change.**
   `CHANNEL_CODEC_VITAL_VERSION = 0` names the byte the imported codec
   hardcodes (`channel_message_hypothesis.make_channel_message_response` ->
   `legacy.make_runtime_vitals([(channel_id, 0, payload)])`, written as
   `u8tag(0x0B, vital_version)` at
   `current/pf_login_game_server_v141.py:702-704`, re-derived at this commit).
   `GM_GLOBAL_MESSAGE_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED = None` is this lane's send gate
   for 0x9F2C, the same shape as `teleport_wire`'s.  The builder itself stays
   ungated on purpose -- it is a pure byte function its own tests exercise;
   the gate belongs where a socket is decided, which is the action module.
2. **`gm/chat_command_action.py` -- `_say_action`.**  An authorized `/say`
   now yields `(SAY_ACTION_LABEL, pc, frame, 0.0)` when the gate is open, and
   two DIFFERENT named refusals when it is not: `..._say_withheld_no_confirmed_
   gm_global_vital_version_re132_open` (RE-132 has not answered) and
   `..._say_refused_confirmed_version_is_not_the_codec_version` (RE-132
   answered with a byte the imported codec cannot emit).  Collapsing those two
   into one event would make release day look like "still waiting for RE"
   forever.
3. **`SAY_ACTION_LABEL = "LANE_GM_CHAT_SAY_GM_GLOBAL_MESSAGE"` -- and the
   absence of one word in it is load-bearing.**  `runtime.py:3654-3675`
   reopens the move-authority grace window for any queued action whose label
   contains `TELEPORT` (`if action and "TELEPORT" in action[0]`).  The warp
   label must carry it; this one must not.  A `say` label copied from the warp
   path out of symmetry would hand every GM a way to widen the anti-cheat
   window one chat line at a time, while the character never moved.  Pinned
   both directions against that call site's own source, not against a comment.
4. **`tests/test_gm_say_action.py` (new).**  The gate is shut and pinned shut;
   the path works when it is opened; the bytes are the imported codec's bytes;
   the refusal events never echo the GM's typed text; a non-GM gets nothing;
   `say` is no longer reported as "no wire path" and the other four still are.
5. **`GAME_TEST_QUEUE.md` `GT-128`: a grep the tester could never have hit.**
   Its wire-layer criterion said to look for `LANE_GM_CHAT_WARP_FORCE_POS`.
   The real constant has been `LANE_GM_CHAT_WARP_TELEPORT_FORCE_POS` since
   round `gr2q9j` -- not a substring of the other, so the grep fails on a
   working system and the tester writes FAIL.  Struck through, corrected,
   reason recorded in the entry.  Found while writing `GT-133` next to it.

### pf-adversary: NOT APPROVED on the first draft, 8 defects, fixed before push

The two that mattered most were both cases of this round failing at the thing
it was congratulating itself for:

* **D2 -- the new label and all three new event names had zero text pins.**
  Renaming `SAY_ACTION_LABEL` to anything left all 3941 tests green (measured,
  not argued): `SayLabelTests` pinned PROPERTIES (no TELEPORT, ASCII, not the
  warp label) and never the string, and `EventNameContractTests.EXPECTED` --
  a table that exists precisely because "compare the module against its own
  constant" is a tautology -- was never grown.  That is `GT-128`'s bug
  verbatim, shipped again in the same round that fixed `GT-128`.  Both labels
  and all three events are now pinned as text, plus a completeness assertion
  so the tables cannot silently fail to grow again.  Re-measured after the
  fix: renaming the label is red.
* **D3 -- the identity blocker above.**  The blocker table said two; there
  were three, and `runtime.py` itself says the missing one must be answered
  BEFORE an executor is wired onto that point.

The rest: **D1** this gate is lane-local, not repo-wide -- `runtime.py:2130`'s
channel-sweep scenario already composes and sends a real 0x9F2C frame carrying
the very byte RE-132 asks about, and `GT-016` (already queued, named in
`docs/HYPOTHESIS_LEDGER.json` and `docs/FUNCTIONAL_COVERAGE.json`) measures it
from the higher client-observable rung; **D4** "shortest path to a screen" was
a proposal wearing a measurement's clothes -- GMGlobal is not among the eight
per-channel style names in CHAT-CHANNEL-001's downcast chain, so RE-132 now
asks for that branch body too; **D5** the codec-mismatch event collided with
the `..._say_refused_` prefix whose contract is "exception type names only",
renamed; **D6** the TELEPORT rule is scenario-gated (`runtime.py:4518-4521`),
not global as the comment claimed, and the test that pinned it stayed green
with the call site deleted -- both fixed; **D7** "no durable row" -> "no DB
row" (an ndjson audit row IS written, and GT-133 counts exactly those);
**D8** `say_wire` caught only `ValueError` from a codec that raises
`RuntimeError` on all five drift checks, breaking its own "every failure
surfaces as `SayWireError`" promise.

What adversary tried and could NOT break, stated because each is a place this
round would have deserved a defect: eight mutations of `_say_action` (delete
either gate, put TELEPORT in the label, compose bytes locally, read the warp
constant instead) all go red; the two gates are genuinely independent; no
hostile session or payload shape escapes as an exception on the listener
thread; `CHANNEL_CODEC_VITAL_VERSION = 0` re-derives exactly as its comment
claims; and no pinned evidence anywhere in the repo covers 0x9F2C's envelope
byte -- both capture-derived cross-checks in `channel_message_hypothesis.py`
return early for any channel that is not LocalTalk (`:573`, `:588`).
**RE-132 is not theatre.**

### What did NOT change

No byte leaves the server.  Both gates are shut, for different reasons, and
neither can be opened by this lane alone.  `warp`'s constant is under
`COO-DECISION 20260828_2130` plus `tests/test_gm_force_pos_version_lock.py`;
`say`'s waits on `RE-132`, and if RE-132 answers with a byte that is not
`CHANNEL_CODEC_VITAL_VERSION`, the lane will NOT open the constant and will
NOT write a second codec in its own zone (that round was tried and retracted
on 2026-08-27) -- it will ask the owning lane for a version parameter.

## Round `z6gu2n`: the destination comes out of the lane, and RE-132 is spent

Two things happened between rounds, and they pull in opposite directions.

**Chief wired GM-030 and then filed its limit himself.**  `runtime.py` now
prints `GM_WARP_POSITION_CONFIRMED` when the first position report after a GM
warp causes a real durable write (PR #212, merged; re-run here on main with
`tests/test_gm_force_pos_version_lock.py` + `tests/test_gm_warp_position_
confirmed.py` = 20 passed, which is the check chief asked this lane to make
because his own clone predated the lane's lock file).  His appendix item 5
says what the token cannot say: the action tuple `(label, pc, frame, delay)`
carries no destination, so the token means "a row was written", never "the row
is the point the GM asked for" -- and the destination only exists inside this
lane.

**RE-132 came back, and it did not unblock what people expected.**  The byte
is `0` (client's own base constructor, `mov byte ptr [esi+0x10],al` at
`0x00657CC9`, reached from 0x9F2C's prototype at `0x0065BCD0`), equal to the
byte the codec already emits; and question 3 found the handler both vtables
bind (`0x0065C850`) is not a `mov al,1; ret 4` -- it routes, reads the body
wstring at `+0x18`, and calls a display sink.  That is two of the four
release-day items in `say_wire.py` gone.  The gate is still `None`, because
the remaining item is the one nothing static can touch: per-connection
identity at `runtime.py:4765-4774`.

### What shipped

1. **`gm/warp_target_record.py` (new).**  Parks one `WarpTarget` on the
   session an accepted warp was built for, and hands it back **once**.  On the
   session and not in a module-level map: the record must die with the
   connection and must never be readable from another one, and a map keyed by
   anything coarser than the session would hand connection A's target to
   connection B -- a second copy of the identity confusion this lane spends
   its rounds refusing to add to.  Also `distance_to_target` /
   `position_matches_target`, where every not-comparable case (another scene,
   a missing axis, NaN, Inf, an overflowing square measured live at 1e200) is
   `None`/False rather than a number that reads as "close".
2. **`gm/warp_executor.py` + `gm/teleport_wire.py` -- the target is the wire.**
   `make_warp_force_pos_frame_with_target` validates ONCE and the old
   `make_warp_force_pos_frame` delegates to it, so the recorded target and the
   frame bytes cannot disagree even for a hand-built `GmCommand` whose
   `__float__` returns a new number every call (pinned by a test that counts
   the reads).  The coordinates are read back out of the payload via
   `make_force_pos_frame_with_body`, so they are the binary32 values the
   client receives -- `11865.7` typed is `11865.6997...` on the wire, and a
   comparison against the typed value would charge that gap to the client at
   every coordinate in the tens of thousands.
3. **`gm/chat_command_action.py`.**  The target is parked after the frame is
   built and never before: the version gate shut, a cross-scene refusal, a
   non-GM, a `/say`, a GM with no selected character -- five paths that send
   no bytes, one test each.  (`_make_action` has more no-byte paths than
   that -- bad session, bad payload, an unwired command; these five are the
   ones a future edit could plausibly move the parking above.)  A session that
   cannot hold the record still gets its warp and gets
   `gm_chat_action_warp_target_not_recorded`, deliberately outside the
   refused-prefix family whose consumers read it as "nothing was sent".
4. **`gm/say_wire.py` -- RE-132 pinned, gate untouched.**
   `GM_GLOBAL_MESSAGE_VITAL_VERSION_RE132_STATIC = 0` plus the image SHA-256
   and three VAs, kept SEPARATE from the send gate because they answer
   different questions ("what byte?" vs "may we send?").  Collapsing them
   would make a lane blocked on identity look like a lane waiting for RE work
   that is already paid for.  A test pins that the send path never reads the
   static one.
5. **`tests/test_gm_force_pos_version_lock.py`.**  `VERSION_TAKING_BUILDERS`
   gained both new builder names.  This was not tidiness: the delegation moved
   the last shipped `make_force_pos_frame` call site, and the lock's own
   tripwire (`test_the_scan_actually_sees_the_calls_it_claims_to_check`) went
   red -- correctly -- because a literal version byte passed to the new name
   would have walked straight through COO's lock with every other test green.

### pf-adversary รอบ `z6gu2n`: NOT APPROVED รอบแรก — 10 ข้อ แก้ก่อน commit ทั้งหมด

The findings that changed the design, not just the wording:

1. **[fatal] The COO lock's own tripwire became self-satisfying.**  Making
   `make_warp_force_pos_frame` delegate meant both scanned builder names were
   called from inside their own defining modules, so adversary deleted the
   ONLY production ForcePos composition site
   (`chat_command_action.py`, replaced with `raise RuntimeError`) and
   `test_gm_force_pos_version_lock.py` stayed green: seven passed with nothing
   in the repo able to compose a ForcePos frame.  A tripwire a delegation can
   satisfy is not a tripwire.  Fixed by counting only CROSS-MODULE calls (a
   call from a file that does not define the builder) and asserting the real
   call site by name; re-run of the same mutant now fails, as it must.
2. **[fatal] `current_character_id` returned `None` for two different things**
   -- "no character selected" and "id unreadable" -- and `None == None`, so
   two connections that both failed to read an id matched each other and one
   GM's destination could be handed to another character.  Now
   `UNREADABLE_CHARACTER_ID`, a sentinel `take_warp_target_with_reason`
   REFUSES rather than compares.
3. **[fatal] `distance_to_target` raised the exception it guards.**
   `isinstance(x, int)` admits arbitrary precision and `float(10**400)` raises
   `OverflowError` one line above the `except OverflowError`.  Reproduced live;
   both conversions are guarded now.
4. **[fatal] `current_character_id` was unguarded on the dispatch path** and
   ran AFTER the frame existed, so a `selected.id` property that raises threw
   away a warp that was already built and blamed this module on the event
   trail.  It never raises now, and a test drives that through the real path.
5. **`runtime.py:4765-4774` had drifted** to damage dispatch; the identity text
   is at 4886-4896.  Every citation in this lane now names the anchor
   (`IDENTITY, STATED HONESTLY`), and a test greps `runtime.py` for it, so the
   load-bearing citation cannot rot silently again.
6. **The say_wire write-up overclaimed against its own text** -- "the reason it
   stays None is now exactly ONE item" while release-day item 0 names two and
   the screen is a third.  RE-132 removed the cheapest way (B) could fail (a
   handler that draws nothing); it did not satisfy (B).  Rewritten to count
   three.
7. Smaller, all fixed: `record_warp_target` returning True for a session that
   SWALLOWS the write (now reads back); consume-once broken when the clear
   fails (now refuses with `REASON_NOT_CLEARED`); `tolerance=inf` turning the
   comparison into `return True`; a "five paths, five tests" count that was
   four; the four `RE132_*` pins that nothing read (now pinned by a test); and
   `FakeSession`'s "three attributes and nothing else" docstring, which this
   round's own edit walked past -- replaced by `SessionSurfaceTests`, which
   measures every attribute name the module touches.

What adversary tried and could not break, which is the other half of the
deliverable: 35,343 random float64 triples through encode/decode with zero
round-trip mismatches and zero new refusals; the send gate (a mutant making
`_say_action` read the static pin is caught by two tests); a literal version
byte passed to either new builder name; the target-as-float64 mutant; removing
the character guard; and any cross-connection leak -- the module has no
module-level mutable state at all.

## Round `nz0qt2`: the audit log can finally tell a withheld command from a sent one

`COO-DECISION 20260829_0041` item 2 measured the hole, and it is a bad one for
a lane whose whole permission story is its audit trail: `handle_local_talk_chat`
writes its ndjson row BEFORE any version gate is read, so `/warp 2 100 200`
typed with the ForcePos gate shut (nothing on the wire) and the same line typed
on the day the gate opens (a real frame handed to `runtime.py`) produced rows
that differed only in their timestamp.  `GT-127` decides on that file.

`CORE-REQUEST-GM-032` split the fix in two zones and this round did the half
that is this lane's (items 1-2).  Item 3 -- the word `queued` -- is chief's and
is still open.

### What shipped

1. **A second audit row.**  One GM command now writes `issued` (unchanged in
   every field, so nothing that already reads the file breaks) and then
   `outcome`, tied by one `record_id`.  Appended, never an amend: this house
   does not rewrite history, and two rows carry the ORDER of events, which one
   mutated row cannot.
2. **One write point, on purpose.**  `_warp_action`/`_say_action` now return
   `(action, outcome)` and `_make_action` writes the row.  An audit appended at
   four different `return` statements grows a fifth `return` that forgets it.
3. **The vocabulary, and the one word held back.**  `withheld_<gate>` names the
   shut gate (so a reader goes straight to RE-129 or RE-132), `refused_<reason>`
   carries an exception TYPE name only, and `composed` is the strongest honest
   claim available here: the frame exists and was handed back.  Not `queued` --
   `actions = actions + [gm_action]` happens in a zone this lane cannot read.
   `tests/test_gm_command_audit_outcome.py::QueuedIsReservedTests` walks BOTH
   halves of the lane's zone (`gm/*.py` and `lane_hooks/lane_gm_*.py`, the
   probe-G lesson from round `xk4wmz`) and goes red if any file names the
   reserved word, so the day item 3 lands, someone has to delete a test that
   says why they may not -- it cannot be drifted into.

### Defects this round nearly shipped: two caught in self-review, four by adversary

1. **Fail-closed had to extend to the second row.**  `handle_local_talk_chat`
   already refuses to hand onward a command it could not record; a composed
   frame whose outcome row cannot be written is the same failure one row later,
   so it is withheld (`gm_chat_action_outcome_not_audited_action_withheld`)
   rather than sent with a trail that says only "a GM typed something".
2. **The parked warp target had to go with it.**  `_warp_action` parks the
   destination only AFTER the frame exists, precisely so "no bytes went out"
   and "a target is parked" can never disagree.  Withholding a composed action
   for an audit failure is a NEW route to exactly that disagreement, and a
   target left behind would let chief's confirmation token (CORE-REQUEST-GM-031)
   match the player's next ordinary step against a warp nobody sent -- the same
   class of false green that has `GT-128` blocked.  Cleared, with a paired test
   (cleared when withheld / not cleared when the warp really goes).

### What this round did NOT do

No gate was opened and no byte went out; `NoBytesWentOutTests` pins both
constants as `None` on the shipped tree, so every `composed` row in the suite
came from a patched gate.  `GT-016`'s 18-Aug evidence (the client really does
draw a `[GM]` line from a GMGlobal frame, byte `0`) was consumed this round and
deliberately did NOT open the say gate: chief's own letter says that boot ran
under two opt-in scenario files and never touched condition (A), per-connection
identity, which is the whole reason `COO-DECISION 20260829_0041` locked it.

### The other finding of the round, which is not about code

`pirate-force-server#218` -- chief's reconnection of the owner-approved
`production_allowed` kill switch, ordered by COO with a 12:00 deadline -- is
`state=closed merged=false`, and `module_production_allowed` greps 0 hit on
main `b79bb87`.  His letter at 01:03 said "PR #218, waiting to merge", which was
true when he wrote it.  `GT-127`'s HOLD depends on that switch, so the entry now
carries the measured status instead of "waiting on chief" forever, and the
finding went to him as its own letter so he can recover it under ADDENDUM v2
step A.  This lane touched neither his branch nor `runtime.py`.

### What pf-adversary broke, run on a separate worktree

Round `xk4wmz` recorded that the adversary had written probes into the round's
own tree and edited `runtime.py` (chief's zone).  This round it ran on a
`git worktree` copy carrying the round's patch, and the work tree was never
touched.  It reported damaging that copy mid-run, restoring it from the patch,
and discarding a polluted mutation batch to re-run the whole matrix -- which is
why the numbers below are worth believing.

Four findings that mattered, all fixed before merge:

1. **`queued` was writable today.** It wrote a function into
   `lane_hooks/lane_gm_chat_command.py` that passed `AUDIT_OUTCOMES[-1]`
   straight into the writer, and the reserved word landed in the ndjson file
   with all 519 GM tests green -- because an AST scan matches names and string
   literals, and a tuple index is neither.  **A source-shaped scan cannot make
   an output-shaped guarantee.**  Fixed where it belongs: `queued` is out of
   `AUDIT_OUTCOMES`, `is_known_outcome` returns False for it, and the writer
   raises with the reason.  The scan stays as the early warning; the writer is
   the door.
2. **Every assertion compared the row to the constant, never to the literal.**
   Mutating `OUTCOME_COMPOSED` to `"queued"` and then to `"sent"` left the
   whole suite green while the audit file said something false.  The file's own
   bytes are now pinned.
3. **`GT-127` had a SECOND pass-criteria block** -- the one literally headed
   `### pass criteria` -- still demanding "exactly 2 records" and the dead
   `gm_chat_command_*` event names.  A tester following it would have recorded
   FAIL on a healthy build: the same scar as job 1331, in the same ticket the
   previous round thought it had repaired.  Rewritten, with "if this disagrees
   with P1, P1 wins", plus two more stale spots it turned up (`GT-127`'s
   background block and `GT-133`'s row-count criterion, whose double-wire check
   is now "count distinct `record_id`s").
4. **The outcome row's `executed` field was unpinned** (a `True` mutant
   survived), and the file has a **third** state nobody had named: an `issued`
   row with no `outcome` row, reachable four ways.  Both closed --
   `HalfPairTests` pins the one thing a reader must be able to conclude from a
   half-pair, which is that **nothing was sent**.

It also measured that `_append_audit_record`'s inherited O_APPEND comment is
false -- O_APPEND makes each `write(2)` atomic, not a *sequence* of them, and
its probe produced two unparseable lines including a real command's `issued`
row.  The comment now says what the loop actually buys (detection, not
atomicity) and that this round doubled the window by doubling the writes per
command.

What it could not break, which is the other half of the deliverable: no path
returns an action without its outcome row (five mutants aimed at exactly that,
all red), the new fail-closed path creates no wider outage than the one the
issued row already had, and the file modes plus short-write handling that moved
into the shared helper are still killed by their own tests.

Suite after every fix: **4080 passed, 327 skipped** (cloud sanity).

## Round `gejldf`: `/warp` stops dead-ending, by taking the door that is already open

`/warp` had exactly one half.  `warp <scene_id> x y` INSIDE the scene the
connection is already in composes a `ForcePos` frame -- and that half is
frozen shut by COO order (`FORCE_POS_VITAL_VERSION_CONFIRMED = None`,
COO-DECISION 20260829_0041, liftable only by a new COO-DECISION).  Every
other form of `/warp` -- a different scene, or the bare `warp <scene_id>` --
was REFUSED, because `ForcePos` carries no scene id (RE-129) and
`TeleportVital`'s target/aux fields are unproven (RE-090), and this lane does
not guess bytes.

So a tester who typed `/warp 126` got a refusal and no way at all to see
scene 126, while a path that DOES cross scenes sat one config file away,
already wired into `runtime.py`'s login path and already tested: the
per-account login-scene override (GM-005, `CORE-REQUEST-016`), which
`login_scene_override.get_login_scene_override` re-reads FRESH ON EVERY
LOGIN.  This round connects the command the owner asked for to the mechanism
that works.

### What shipped

`gm/login_scene_stage.py` (new).  `stage_login_scene(account, scene_id)`
writes ONE entry into `config/gm_login_scene.json`; `restore_login_scene`
takes it back off.  `gm/chat_command_action.py` routes `/warp` to it for
every form except same-scene-with-coordinates, and audits the result with two
new words, `staged_login_scene` and `staged_login_scene_coords_ignored`
(`gm/commands.py`).  `gm/warp_executor.py` grew two public readers
(`warp_command_scene_id`, `warp_command_has_coordinates`) so the routing
decision and the frame builder validate a hand-built `GmCommand` through ONE
implementation, and `gm/login_scene_override.py` grew
`resolve_gm_login_scene_config_path` so the writer and the reader can never
resolve to two different files (`PF_GM_LOGIN_SCENE_CONFIG` is the case that
would otherwise look like it worked and change nothing).

### What it is not, said in the module and repeated here

It is NOT a warp.  No frame is composed, no byte goes on the wire, and
nothing at all happens until the GM logs out and back in.  `executed` stays
`false` in the audit row, because the gameplay command did not execute -- a
config entry was written, and the outcome word says exactly that.  `GT-141`
carries the same sentence as a nonclaim: seeing the island because a GM
staged the scene is not the sea route working.

### Why it cannot grant anything

* Only the GM-GATED map (`gm_login_scene`) is writable.  The STANDALONE map,
  which grants a login scene to an account with no `gm_accounts.json`
  membership at all, is unreachable from this writer -- checked behaviourally
  AND by reading the module's own source, since the last round's lesson was
  that a source-shaped scan cannot make an output-shaped guarantee (so the
  scan is the early warning; the absence of any import is the door).
* An entry is worth nothing on its own: `get_login_scene_override` re-checks
  `is_gm_account` at login time, so removing the account from the allowlist
  disarms a staged entry without touching this file.
* A refusal leaves the config byte-identical, including the case where an
  operator's file is already malformed: this module validates the whole file
  through the READER's own rules before writing and again after, and restores
  the original bytes if the read-back disagrees.  A config writer that
  "repairs" a file it did not understand is worse than one that refuses.

### The identity limit, named before anyone asks

[สมมติของสาย GM - รอ COO ยืนยัน]  `session.token` is the process-wide
`--token`, not a per-connection authenticated login, so on a listener whose
token is a listed GM account ANY connected player who types `/warp 126`
stages that account's next login scene.  Every command in this lane already
shares that gap; this is the first one whose effect OUTLIVES the chat line,
which is why it is in the module docstring, in the round letter, and in an
ASK-COO of its own rather than left to be discovered.  Blast radius: a listed
GM logs in somewhere else next time, recoverable by typing another `/warp` or
deleting the config.  No status, no command, no frame.

### The reorder, which is the one behaviour change nobody asked for

The version gate used to be the FIRST thing `_warp_action` read, so with the
gate shut every warp wrote `withheld_force_pos_vital_version`.  It is now
read only on the branch it actually governs.  A cross-scene warp never
touches it and no longer claims to have been withheld by a gate that had
nothing to do with why it did nothing.  Cost: with no current position, the
outcome is now `refused_warp_no_current_position` where it used to be the
version word -- more honest (this function cannot route without a scene), and
unreachable in production, where the call site requires a selected character.

### Tickets moved in the same round, not the next one

`GT-127`'s P1 told the tester `/warp 2` produces
`withheld_force_pos_vital_version`.  This round made that false, so this
round rewrote it -- PANYA-RULING 20260829_0127, the lane that changes the
fact fixes the entry in the same round as the code.  It also gained the
cleanup step the new behaviour needs: `/warp 2` now WRITES a file, and a
tester who leaves it there logs into Prison Exile forever after.  `GT-141` is
the new attended entry for the thing itself (stage, relog, see the island).

### Tests

`tests/test_gm_login_scene_stage.py` (new, 27 cases): grants-nothing,
writes-what-the-reader-reads, refusal-leaves-the-file-alone, hostile
arguments, restore.  `tests/test_gm_command_audit_outcome.py` gained
`StagedLoginSceneRowTests`, including the property that cost the design work:
a command whose `outcome` row cannot be written takes its staged entry BACK
OFF DISK, because unlike every other outcome in this vocabulary this one has
already changed durable state by the time the write point is reached -- and
an undo that fails is named (`gm_chat_action_outcome_stage_not_reverted`)
rather than silent.

Two test files also gained a throwaway config path in `setUp`: the first run
of the new routing created a real `config/gm_login_scene.json` under the
repo checkout, which is a test writing into the tree it is testing.

### The adversarial pass, run by hand after the subagent stalled

`pf-adversary` was launched on a separate `git worktree` carrying this
round's patch, the way round `nz0qt2` recorded it must be.  It produced 110
bytes of transcript and then stopped writing for four minutes with nothing
in the copy to show for it, so the round ran the pass itself rather than
either waiting or claiming a review that had not happened.  What that
means, stated rather than glossed: what follows is a self-review with the
same tools, not an independent one, and the next round should treat this
module as still owing an outside pass.

**Mutation matrix, 12 mutants, all DEAD** (run on the worktree copy, GM
test files only): the two new audit words mutated to `composed`, to
`queued`, and into each other; the routing predicate with its bare-form
clause dropped and then forced always-true; the undo call disabled; the
allowlist check, the catalog check, the bool-scene_id check and the
str-subclass check each removed; the JSON key switched to the standalone
one; and the restore-after-a-bad-read-back deleted.  Every one of them
turned at least one test red.

**Three probes, two of which found real defects** -- both fixed in this
round, both about walking over an operator rather than about a client:

1. **A symlinked config was replaced, not written through.**  `os.replace`
   renames onto the path it is given, and that path was the link: the link
   became a regular file, the file the operator actually maintains kept the
   old content, and the login path read the new one from then on.  Two
   configs, no error, nothing to notice.  Fixed by resolving the path
   first, which also keeps the temp file on the target's own filesystem --
   the thing that makes the rename atomic at all.
2. **A `chmod 400` config was overwritten and came back `0o600`.**
   `os.replace` needs the DIRECTORY's write bit, not the file's, so an
   operator saying "do not touch this" in the only way a file can say it
   was ignored.  Now `REASON_CONFIG_NOT_WRITABLE`, one `os.access` call.
3. **A failed rename leaves no temp file behind** -- probed because a
   stray `.gm_login_scene.XXXX` in `config/` is one more file an operator
   has to reason about.  Clean, and now pinned by a test.

## Round `ank2vl` (2026-08-29 04:1x +07:00) -- the round above was lost, and why

Everything written in the section before this one was true of the code and
false of `main`.  `pirate-force-server#224` never merged: the Windows gate
went red, and `merge-claude-pr.yml` closed the PR to stop a red lane lock
jamming every later round shut.  The branch was kept, the work was
recovered here, and this section is about the one line that cost it.

### What actually failed (Actions run 33210364835, job `gate`)

```
tests\test_gm_login_scene_stage.py:295: in RefusalLeavesTheFileAloneTests
    @unittest.skipIf(os.geteuid() == 0, "root ignores directory write bits")
E   AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'geteuid'
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Interrupted: 1 error during collection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

Two things about that are worth keeping, because neither is obvious from
reading the line:

1. **A `skipIf` protects the test body, never its own argument.**  The
   decorator's condition is evaluated while the class body runs -- at
   import.  `os.geteuid()` therefore ran on Windows no matter that an
   `os.name == "nt"` skip sat directly above it.  There is no ordering of
   decorators that would have saved it.
2. **A collection error is not one red test, it is the whole gate.**
   pytest aborted, so `pytest_subset` exited 2 AND `skip_census` exited 1 --
   the census saw 0 skips where nine modules pin 48 between them, and
   reported nine PIN DRIFTs that had nothing to do with the defect.  Two
   red checks, one cause; chasing the census entries first would have been
   a whole round spent on a symptom.

### What was changed, and one thing that was deliberately NOT done

The obvious repair -- `getattr(os, "geteuid", None)` -- was made.  But that
alone would still have lost the round on the SECOND fault the first one was
hiding, and the first attempt at the repair introduced a THIRD, caught by
pf-adversary before this shipped and worth recording because the mistake is
easy to repeat.

**WITHDRAWN, and why.**  The first version of this repair folded the "not
Windows" half of the question into one constant, `PERMISSION_BITS_BITE`,
on the reasoning that "a mode bit NTFS ignores is the same non-condition as
one root ignores."  **That sentence is false**, and it cost real coverage:
NTFS does not RECORD the owner/group/other split; root records it perfectly
and merely declines to OBEY it.  `stat()` under root returns exactly what
`chmod` wrote.  Routing an assertion about what the writer WROTE through the
OBEY question therefore disabled it on the gate machine and in every root
container -- measured: mutating `os.chmod(temp_path, 0o600)` to `0o666`, which
makes the GM login-scene config world-writable, stayed GREEN as root and
would have stayed green on Windows, while the sibling files in this lane
(`tests/test_gm_commands.py:317`, `tests/test_gm_command_capture.py:241`)
still caught it.

So the file now carries two constants, and every branch says which question
it is asking: `MODE_BITS_RECORDED` (`os.name == "posix"`) for what was
written, `MODE_BITS_OBEYED` (that, and not root) for a refusal the OS has to
produce.  Re-measured after the split: the same `0o666` mutant now fails as
root, at `test_the_config_file_is_not_world_readable`.

`docs/PYTEST_SKIP_PINS.json` pins every skip this suite is allowed to
produce, and an unpinned skip turns the gate red on its own.  This file's
four platform skips were unpinned, and that pin file is outside this lane's
write zone.  So the four skips were **removed**, not repaired: each test now
runs on both platforms with the platform-specific assertion behind an
in-body branch -- the pattern `tests/test_gm_commands.py` and
`tests/test_gm_command_capture.py` already used in this lane.

Where a mode bit could not deny this process (Windows, or root), the refusal
under test is reached the portable way instead -- and at the same place the
real `chmod` reaches it, which the first attempt got wrong: a read-only
directory makes `tempfile.mkstemp` fail BEFORE any temp file exists, so that
is what the substitute patches.  (Patching `os.replace` instead, as the first
version did, fails AFTER a fully written temp file -- a different code path
under the same test name -- and it also disabled the restore path that the
second half of that same test checks, making that half unfalsifiable.)  The
read-only-config case answers no through `os.access`, the call the module
actually consults; mutating that guard away, or changing `os.W_OK` to
`os.R_OK`, turns the test red as root, so it is testing the real decision and
not the mock.

These substitutes are still weaker than a real `chmod` and are labelled as
such: they prove the module refuses when the OS says no, not that this OS
says no.  The strong form runs wherever the bits are obeyed -- every non-root
POSIX machine, the bridge included.

The symlink test keeps the same shape but not the same evidence as the first
attempt: where a symlink cannot be made (Windows without
`SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`), it no longer greps the module's source for
the literal `os.path.realpath(path)` -- renaming a local variable would have
turned the Windows gate red while changing no behaviour at all, which is the
exact failure this round exists to stop.  It now patches `os.path.realpath`
and asserts behaviourally that the write lands on the RESOLVED file and not
on the path it was handed.

### The tripwire

`tests/test_gm_tests_collect_without_posix.py` imports **every**
`tests/test_gm_*.py` for real, in a child process with the POSIX-only names
deleted from `os` and the POSIX-only modules refusing to import.  It is not
a grep for `os.geteuid`; it reproduces the failure mode.

Its first version claimed more than it did.  pf-adversary drove six real
gaps straight past it -- `os.setpriority`, `os.wait`, `signal.SIGKILL`,
`socket.AF_UNIX`, `select.epoll` and `readline`, every one absent on Windows
and every one able to abort collection exactly as `geteuid` did.  Two of the
six sat inside the very module the list claimed to cover (it pinned
`getpriority` but not `setpriority`, `wait3`/`wait4` but not `wait`), which
is what hand enumeration looks like from the outside.  All six are now
pinned by their own bait tests, the list reaches other modules besides `os`,
and the docstring states plainly that the lists are `[proposed]` and only
`geteuid` is measured.

One thing was tried and NOT shipped, recorded because the negative result is
worth as much: setting `os.name = "nt"` in the child, so import-time
`if os.name == "nt":` branches would execute, produces a **false red** on all
28 lane-GM modules -- `pathlib.Path()` picks `WindowsPath` off `os.name` at
instantiation and every file dies with `NotImplementedError`, for a reason
unrelated to the defect.  A probe that cries wolf on every file is worse
than a narrower one, so the `nt` half of an import-time branch remains
unwitnessed, and the docstring says so rather than implying coverage.

It also now fails if a `tests/test_gm_*.py` file exists on disk but is not
tracked by git.  That is not tidiness: the gate checks out what git has, and
pf-adversary found this very file unstaged in the round that wrote it --
which would have shipped the whole "stop it recurring" deliverable as zero
bytes on the only machine that decides.

Measured both ways before it was believed: the file exactly as `#224`
pushed it fails the probe with `AttributeError: module 'os' has no
attribute 'geteuid'` -- the gate's own message -- and the repaired file
passes.  A third test feeds the probe a bait file carrying that same line,
so a probe that quietly stopped importing anything cannot keep reporting
success.

### nonclaim

1. **No GM capability changed this round, in any direction.**  Nothing new
   can be granted, nothing that could be granted before cannot be now; the
   recovered work is byte-for-byte what `#224` carried apart from the two
   test files named above.  **ไม่มีการใช้ GM ข้ามขั้นใดในรอบนี้** -- no
   milestone is claimed and none could be.
2. This does not prove the round passes the Windows gate.  It proves the
   two checks that failed pass their local equivalents: the full client-free
   subset with the gate's own 48 exclusions (3355 passed, 8 skipped, 0
   failed) and `tools/pf_pytest_precondition_census.py` over that
   transcript (RESULT: PASS, every skip declared and pinned).  Only Actions
   decides -- เขียว(cloud sanity) is the claim here, not เขียว(Actions).
3. The Linux container runs as root, so `MODE_BITS_OBEYED` is False here and
   the substitute branches are what ran locally; the strong branches were
   exercised by re-running as an unprivileged user (`nobody`).  Zero skips
   both ways -- checked, because a skip is the other way this round could
   have been lost.  Neither run is Windows.
4. The round's own review was NOT self-review this time: `pf-adversary`
   reported ten defects and this section is what survived them.  Two were
   false greens (the mode-bit conflation above, and the tripwire's list),
   one was the unstaged file, and the rest are folded in above.  It also
   destroyed an uncommitted draft of this very section with a
   `git checkout --`; the section was rewritten rather than reconstructed
   from memory, and nothing else in the tree was lost.
