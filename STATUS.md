# Pirate Force Server — Foundation Status

Updated: 2026-08-15

## Baselines

- V140 remains the latest runtime-proven evidence checkpoint.
- V141 is closed as a legacy characterization baseline: packaged and deterministic
  offline self-tested. A raw runtime capture exists but has not been formally audited,
  reported or promoted; V141 therefore adds no accepted gameplay claim.
- Foundation work introduces no V142 protocol/gameplay hypothesis.

## Foundation gates

- Modular typed Python core: implemented.
- Migration-first SQLite with WAL, foreign keys, transactions, accounts,
  characters, opaque actor/avatar wire, sessions, soft-delete field, and position:
  implemented.
- Atomic migrations with checksums, stale-session replacement and session-bound
  finite position checkpoints: implemented and negative-tested offline.
- Character Create -> List -> Select -> StartGame identity continuity: implemented
  in the V141 dispatch adapter across actor, AvatarAttr, ActorAttr and MovementAttr;
  unknown job/class bytes remain opaque.
- Commit-before-reply: implemented for character creation and selection.
- Golden/state/restart/loopback/negative/legacy-dispatch verification: implemented.
- Deterministic source archive verification: implemented and excluded from Git.
- A live assisted-UI run now proves Create -> commit -> List -> Select -> StartGame,
  a position checkpoint, client exit/relaunch, and reload of the same `Arena01`
  character and scene-1 position while the same server process remained running.
  Server-process restart/crash durability, delete, world-visible player name and
  authenticated multi-account ownership remain unproven.

## Test Arena V1

- Opt-in scenario `arena_v1_player_p30_target` is implemented and offline-tested.
- It preserves Full Flow, then replaces only the inherited first population with
  one test-only P30/Tornado Eagle at player-relative `+100X,+50Y`.
- The exact target profile retains template 31, identity `0x201F`, HP 3857/3857,
  and BasicAttr name `Tornado Eagle`.
- Arena V1 has an assisted GameClient runtime result. The client rendered one
  `Tornado Eagle` model, displayed HP 3857, and emitted the exact P30 TargetVital
  after click; more than 60 post-target runtime states continued with no error or
  disconnect marker.
- Hostile-monster classification is a runtime negative: the ordinary stable view
  used a green name, person target icon and talk cursor. An operator observed a
  possible momentary red name/sword cursor during shutdown, but that is not captured
  or reproducible yet and is treated only as a teardown/hover hypothesis.
- Arena V1 therefore proves object spawn/render/name/HP/click-target transport, not
  hostile relation, combat, AI, damage or loot.
- Combat, AI, damage, loot, Tab selection and authentic placement are nonclaims.

The legacy V141 source remains immutable and is loaded as a compatibility oracle.
Gameplay dispatch falls through to it unchanged outside the lifecycle boundary.
The configured server token currently identifies one local test account. Authenticated
multi-account ownership, delete UI, world-visible character name, job/class semantics,
name uniqueness policy, inventory persistence and crash-time live capture remain later gates.
